Chuck Grassley. Finkenauer pledged Monday to \u201a\u00c4\u00fachallenge this deeply partisan decision to the Iowa Supreme Court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Sunday night, Polk County District Judge Scott Beattie ruled that Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name \u201a\u00c4\u00fashall not be included on the primary ballot for the Democratic Primary for U.S. Senate.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The ruling centers around a dispute over the signatures required to get on the ballot. Although Finkenaur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign submitted more than the necessary 3,500 signatures, the judge found that she did not meet the requirement that each candidate have at least 100 signatures from at least 19 Iowa counties due to questions about three signatures obtained from Allamakee and Cedar counties. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Court takes no joy in this conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beattie wrote. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis Court should not be in the position to make a difference in an election, and Ms. Finkenauer and her supporters should have a chance to advance her candidacy. However, this Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s job is to sit as a referee and apply the law without passion or prejudice. It is required to rule without consideration of the politics of the day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finkenauer initially responded to the decision by saying her campaign was \u201a\u00c4\u00faexploring all of our options to fight back hard.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Later on Monday, Finkenauer announced she would challenge the decision with the Iowa Supreme Court. Finkenauer lawyer asks Iowa Supreme Court to return her to primary ballot in fight over signatures \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe refuse to back down in the face of these partisan attacks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are confident that we have met every requirement to be on the ballot, and we will not stop fighting back against this meritless attack that seeks to silence the voices of tens of thousands of Iowans.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Although Finkenauer has blamed Republicans for her signature issues, Democratic operatives in Iowa have been quietly aghast at how a statewide candidate, let alone someone who successfully ran for Congress recently, cut it so close on the signatures needed to make the ballot. The success of Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge will now rest with seven justices on Iowa\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00ec only one of whom was appointed by a Democrat. If Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge is unsuccessful, the former congresswoman could accept the ruling and run as a write-in candidate in the June primary. This could be complicated by the fact that although Finkenauer, a former congresswoman, was the front-runner in the Democratic field, she is running against two other Democrats: Glenn Hurst, a city council member in Minden, Iowa, and Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral. Republicans have been challenging Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signatures, initially bringing the complaint to the State Objections Panel. The state body decided in March that Finkenauer could stay on the ballot, but just narrowly. The panel found that Finkenauer submitted at least 100 signatures from 20 counties and needed 19. One of those counties was knocked out by the objection but she was able to squeak by with 100 signatures in one challenged county and 101 in two others. But Republicans successfully brought this lawsuit, saying the panel incorrectly interpreted the law. Iowa Republicans celebrated the decision on Monday, with Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann arguing that the questions surrounding Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signatures shows a \u201a\u00c4\u00fasevere lack of enthusiasm behind Iowa Democrats.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot qualifying for the ballot is a complete and utter embarrassment,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kaufmann said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

More than 900 civilians killed in a matter of weeks. Is Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal? His country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine has presented reams of evidence that have led some world leaders \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including US President Joe Biden last week \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to use the loaded label. The question now is what Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which he followed up by calling Putin a \u201a\u00c4\u00famurderous dictator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapure thug\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will mean for the war in Ukraine going forward. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t signal any concern that Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks would roil talks with Russia. He told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Fareed Zakaria that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faready for negotiations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with Putin. (More on this in a minute.) Biden's strategy with Putin is decades in the making Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments represented a major moment since leading officials had mostly avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. But soon after the President uttered the words \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think he is a war criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to reporters at an unrelated event, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the comment was \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom the heart.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Other officials used similar language. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hard not to walk away with that conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 State Department spokesman Ned Price later told CNN. And after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he \u201a\u00c4\u00fapersonally\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 agreed with Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s label of Putin, Psaki told reporters that the top US diplomat was speaking from the heart \u201a\u00c4\u00faas well.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Why all the parsing? While terms like \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar crimes\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are often used colloquially, they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Conventions, which specify intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime. In other words, the White House is being careful to not get ahead of the international investigations probing Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Will Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s words complicate Ukraine-Russia negotiations? The Kremlin called Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks about Putin being a war criminal \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Asked if it would be hard to sit down with Putin, Zelensky maintained Sunday that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ready \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and has been ready. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout delay,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 warning that otherwise Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s losses would be \u201a\u00c4\u00fahuge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The problem, as CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security team reports, is that US and NATO officials believe Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s engagement truly is \u201a\u00c4\u00ec even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Everything you need to know about war crimes and how Putin could be prosecuted The view from the State Department. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday also expressed her personal view that war crimes are being committed in Russia, saying that they \u201a\u00c4\u00faall feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but noted that there must be \u201a\u00c4\u00faa body of proof\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 before a legal determination can be made. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there is virtually no one \u201a\u00c4\u00ec maybe Vladimir Putin is the exception \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who can look at all of the photographs, all of video coming from Ukraine and not believe that Putin is intentionally targeting civilians, and intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in an interview with CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s John Berman on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow, I think we all feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sherman said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in terms of international law, you have to have evidence, you have to have a body of proof that in fact there was intentionality.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added that the United States is \u201a\u00c4\u00fahelping to pull that evidence together, present it to international justice parties and then have a legal threshold that is met.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 How long do war crime investigations take? Investigations at the International Criminal Court take many years, and only a handful of convictions have ever been won. Put differently, it could be a while before Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 remarks have any legal weight \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if ever. As we noted earlier this month, the court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A 72-year-old woman accused of hate crimes against her Vietnamese neighbor has agreed to sell her Seattle-area home as part of a civil agreement with the victim and her family, according to reports. As per the agreement, Jan Myers, who is White, is expected to sell her home in Shoreline, Washington, about nine miles from downtown Seattle, within the next six months and pay the victim, Thi Pham, who is Vietnamese American, $45,000 from that sale, KGW reported. If Myers fails to move from the neighborhood before the time frame is up, the case could be referred to a civil jury. NYC TEEN CHARGED WITH HATE CRIME AFTER GROUP ATTACKS HASIDIC MAN IN BROOKLYN The ordeal began in April 2021 when Pham said she was outside in her front yard gardening when she noticed Myers sitting in the roadway staring at her and beginning to move her car back and forth. Fearful of what would happen next, Pham said she began recording and Myers is seen yelling several racial slurs and threats. Jan Myers is facing hate crime charges for alleged racially charged threats against her Vietnamese American neighbor Thi Pham\u00a0 (King County Sheriff's Office) In the video, Myers is heard calling Pham \"slant eye\" and \"Miss Vietnam\" and threatening \"you\u2019re not going to live very long.\" Pham called police afterward. Two weeks prior, Pham said Myers had walked onto her patio naked from the waist down making obscene gestures in front of her two-year-old son. Myers was charged with a hate crime in April 2021, but a judge released her without bail on her own recognizance shortly after. Pham and her husband, Bill Healy, filed a civil lawsuit in King County Superior Court in August 2021, claiming Myers violated a no contact order and continued to harass them. The couple alleged that Myers screamed at them outside and drove her car straight at Healy. Attorneys for Pham and Healy announced the civil settlement at a press conference Thursday. \"I am happy that I can safely live in my home without racial harassment,\" Pham said, according to KING-TV. \"We hope Jan Myers follow through the agreement and move quickly.\" \"That was what made it very difficult, is when I realized my wife and my family, their physical well-being and their life was being threatened by this person,\" Healy said, according to KIRO.

The Department recommends that children with underlying conditions are the best candidates for the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 it says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faParents are encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits with their children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health care practitioner when evaluating whether their child should receive a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for children with underlying health conditions or comorbidities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Florida is the first state to break from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations that everyone age 5 and older receive the vaccine. Why Florida is now recommending healthy kids *not* get vaccinated against Covid-19 Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Lapado announced the measure on Monday during a roundtable discussion hosted by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Explaining the decision, DeSantis said Ladapo was concerned that the vaccine was \u201a\u00c4\u00fabeing pushed on people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are not just going to follow the CDC in the state of Florida,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to do our own stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The guidance released Tuesday says that the risks of the vaccine outweigh its benefits in children who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have underlying health conditions. It cites reports of increased incidence of myocarditis \u201a\u00c4\u00ec inflammation of the heart muscle \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in 16- and 17-year-olds who got the Covid-19 vaccine. The study that the guidance uses to support this concern also found that the risk of myocarditis is rare, identifying 105.9 cases per 1 million doses of the mRNA vaccine given in 16- to 17-year-olds. Florida surgeon general favorably recommended after Democrats walk out of confirmation hearing The guidance also cites data from a clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found no cases of severe Covid-19 in a group of children ages 5 to 11, whether they received the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. However, that study found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing Covid-19 infection. The department also based the guidance off a New York-based study that found vaccine effectiveness for children ages 5 to 17 dropped significantly during the Omicron surge. But that research concluded that the vaccine continued to be effective against severe disease in children. That study is a preprint and has not been published in a peer-reviewed professional journal, so a note in bold at the top of the study advises that it should not be used to guide clinical practice. Health experts have been very critical of the department\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recommendations. CDC director rebukes DeSantis for scolding high school students over masks: 'It is absolutely their choice' In a statement Tuesday, Dr. Daniel P. McQuillen, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said his group \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrongly opposes the state of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to put politics over the health and safety of children. The Florida Surgeon General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to recommend against COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children flies in the face of the best medical guidance and only serves to further sow distrust in vaccines that have proven to be the safest, most effective defense against severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The head of the University of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health system sent an email Tuesday to staff that distanced the medical network from Ladapo in light of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Dr. David Nelson, the senior vice president for health affairs at the university and president of UF Health, told staff that Ladapo does not speak for the school and acknowledged that his opinions clash with those of other medical experts. Ladapo is a professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine through an agreement with the state.

Congress has been embroiled in a months-long stalemate over new funding to fight the pandemic, with House Democrats stripping additional Covid-relief money from a government funding bill earlier this month at the 11th hour after lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were unable to reach an agreement on how to offset the new spending. According to an administration official, the White House has secured funding to vaccinate children under 5 years old and offer a fourth booster shot to the immunocompromised. Beyond that, however, any other measures would require additional approval from Congress. The White House says that, of the American Rescue Plan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s $1.9 trillion in funding, just $300 billion remains unobligated, $240 billion of which has been allocated for cities and states already. The remaining funding \u201a\u00c4\u00ec approximately $60 billion \u201a\u00c4\u00ec is left for use for a specific emergency use by agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Republican lawmakers have said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll oppose additional funding to fight the pandemic without guaranteed offsets, a demand one senior administration official told reporters was disingenuous, given previous votes to secure emergency funding under the Trump administration that did not have earmarked offset funding. But the White House is warning lawmakers that, absent more relief funds, there won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be sufficient money to subsidize a number of Covid mitigation steps, including programs that provide resources for vaccinations, reimburse providers and insurers for out-of-network treatment, underwrite Covid testing and supply personal protective equipment. The White House has spent much of the last several weeks amping up its warnings that aspects of the federal Covid-19 response will be curtailed if new funding is not approved, with administration officials speaking in dire terms in a call with reporters last week. Among the warnings on that call were that there is not enough money to purchase booster shots for all Americans if another dose is required; domestic testing capability will decrease; the purchase of monoclonal antibody treatments and preventative treatment for immunocompromised individuals will be significantly scaled back; sending vaccines to the rest of the world will be affected; and major effects would be seen on research and development on Covid treatments.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Wednesday that undocumented migrants released into his state will be shipped to the steps of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., as border checkpoints struggle to manage the flow of people attempting to enter the United States and the Biden administration's move to eliminate the Title 42 expulsion provision.

Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said his agency will \"use as many buses as we need\" to follow Abbott's directive. In past emergencies, up to 900 buses have been activated for evacuations, he said. In addition, Abbott signed an order directing the state Department of Public Safety to conduct \"enhanced\" inspections of vehicles crossing into the U.S. from Mexico to ensure residents are not put in danger by unsafe vehicles or unsafe drivers. He also announced actions to deter illegal immigration, such as using razor wire in low-water crossings. This week, the Texas National Guard will begin the first phase of \"mass migration\" rehearsals in preparation for a potential influx of migrants at the border, officials said.

The measure comes as the country grapples with some of the worst housing affordability issues in the world. Prices have jumped more than 20%, pushing the average home in Canada to nearly C$817,000 ($650,000; \u00a3495,000) -  more than nine times household income. But industry analysts say it's not clear a ban on foreign buyers will address the problem. Data on purchases by foreign buyers in Canada is limited, but research suggests they amount for a small fraction of the market. \"I don't think\u00a0it's going to have a huge\u00a0impact,\" said Ben Myers, president of advisory firm Bullpenn Research & Consulting in Toronto, who found foreigners accounted for just 1% of purchases in 2020, down from 9% in 2015 and 2016. \"It's a fairly low number and let's face it, the people that really want to buy ... are going to find alternative ways to do it.\" Mr Myers said the soaring housing costs reflect strong population growth and a shortage of supply, due in part to rules that restrict development. The issues have worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers in Canada and elsewhere slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, lowering borrowing costs and boosting demand even further. The moves have fuelled the soaring housing prices seen in many markets around the world, but in Canada the disconnect between home prices and incomes is one of the most dramatic, according to OECD data. Mr Trudeau pledged to tackle housing affordability during his campaign for election last year. In addition to the temporary ban on foreign buyers, the budget proposal his government unveiled on Thursday sets aside billions to spur new construction and proposes new programmes, such as a tax-free savings account for first-time buyers. This video can not be played Why it takes 30 years to buy a house in Canada Mr Trudeau has also discussed banning certain bidding processes that favour investors, who by some measures have accounted for about one in five homes purchased in Canada since 2014. The proposed ban on foreign buyers would exempt permanent residents and foreign students and workers, as well as those buying their primary residence. The proposal builds on actions such as special taxes that some parts of Canada have already taken against out-of-town and foreign buyers. In Ontario, for example, provincial Premier Doug Ford recently announced plans to raise an existing tax on foreign buyers from 15% to 20% and expand it beyond Toronto to the entire province. While foreign purchases are not the driver of the affordability issues, taxing them at least captures revenue that can be re-deployed to address such problems, said Steve Pomeroy, head of Focus Consulting, a housing policy firm. \"If you ban them, you don't really have much of an impact on suppressing rising home prices and you give up the revenue,\" he said. New Zealand introduced a similar measure banning foreign buyers in 2018. \"It's good politics because it's easy to blame a victim that nobody cares about,\" Mr Pomeroy added. \"I don't think it will have much of an impact.\" Paul Kershaw, professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, also said he saw little in  Mr Trudeau's proposal likely to slow price increases or significantly address affordability. \"It's not clear the housing measures will be sufficient to break Canada's addiction to high and rising home prices,\" he said, noting that for existing homeowners, the high prices help amass wealth. Mr Pomeroy said he does expect price appreciation to slow in coming months, as the central bank raises interest rates. The Canadian housing market is particularly susceptible to such moves, since many buyers rely on five-year mortgages rather than the long-term ones common in the US and UK. But higher interest rates will only make it less affordable for prospective buyers trying to break into the market, he warned. Mr Myers said over the long-term, he expects hot markets such as Toronto and Vancouver to become dominated by renters, as regular buyers get priced out of the market, unless politicians address supply. But Mr Pomeroy said high development costs means that adding supply will not necessarily reduce prices, unless the additions are dramatic. \"Unless you've got born into the right family ... the prospects for young buyers are quite dim,\" he said.

The US Commerce Department has said the planes are in contravention of US sanctions on Russia. Providing service to these aircraft anywhere in the world - including inside Russia - may lead to heavy fines and potential jail time, it says. The list includes aircraft operated by Russian airlines, including Aeroflot. While most are Boeing aircraft, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovich - the current owner of Chelsea football club - is also included. The Russian was among seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government earlier this month in response to the Ukraine war. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. In a statement, the department said any refuelling, maintenance or repair work of any of the listed aircraft - as well as the provision of spare parts - violates US export controls. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was in response to \"Russia's brutal war of choice against Ukraine\". She added: \"We are publishing this list to put the world on notice - we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.\" The department said violators face \"substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions\". The regulations apply to any aircraft which has more than 25% US-origin content that was re-exported to Russia after new controls came into effect on 24 February, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. \"By preventing these aircraft from receiving any service, for example, including from abroad, international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded,\" the statement added. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said the US government hoped the move highlighted Russia's increasing isolation from the global economy. \"Our actions aren't idle words or dead letters on the page,\" he said. \"They have real teeth and as Putin's vicious war continues, they will continue to bite harder on the Russian and Belarusian economies\". The US, Canada and European allies have already banned Russian aircraft from operating in their airspace, forcing Russian airlines to largely abandon their international routes.

Kayla Mueller, 26, was one of several people who died at the hands of a Syria-based IS terror cell dubbed the Beatles due to their British accents. On Tuesday, her mother Marsha spoke at the federal trial of El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, known as \"Jihadi George\". He has denied charges of hostage-taking and conspiracy to murder. Mr Elsheikh is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US and the only alleged member of the notorious Beatles cell to do so. He has been linked to at least 27 abductions, but has asserted that he was not part of the group. The Sudanese-born Londoner, who was stripped of his British citizenship in 2018, is accused of taking hostages, resulting in the deaths of four Americans - Ms Mueller, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. He is also charged with conspiring in the deaths of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. In opening statements last week, his lawyer argued that he was \"a simple ISIS fighter\" who went to Syria alone to support \"suffering Muslims\". But prosecutors played back past media interviews with Mr Elsheikh that contradict the claim he was not involved in the hostage taking scheme. During one interview, Mr Elsheikh describes asking the jailed Ms Mueller for an email address to reach her family, although he goes on to say he never sent any emails. Inside the Virginia courthouse on Tuesday, Ms Mueller's mother described exchanging several emails with the IS captors, in which she begged for her daughter's life. In their first contact with the so-called Beatles, she and her husband Carl were asked to submit proof of life questions for Ms Mueller to answer. Later emails include a video addressed to then-IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in which Marsha wore a hijab \"to show respect\". The Beatles wrote back demanding either a ransom of five million euros or the release of jihadist Aafia Siddiqui from a US federal prison, within 30 days. Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman sometimes known as \"Lady Al-Qaeda\", is serving 86 years for the attempted murder of US soldiers. When the Muellers replied they were retired and the payoff was \"more than [what] we could earn in several lifetimes\", the captors wrote: \"get back to work\", the court heard. The Obama administration had reassured the Muellers that \"IS won't harm a woman\", Marsha testified. But US officials confirmed in February 2015 that Ms Mueller had been killed in custody. Her body was never recovered. Marsha sat just yards away from the accused, who sat still leaning back in his chair and took no notes during the testimony. As the court broke for lunch, Omar Alkhani, who was Ms Mueller's boyfriend and was attending court with her family, got up from his seat, lent over the bar and pointed towards Mr Elsheikh as he was being escorted out. Mr Alkhani raised his voice in Arabic and said: \"He is in hell you will see him there,\" in an apparent reference to the former commander of the prison where Ms Mueller had been held before she died. Emotions continued to run high into the afternoon, with the father of Mr Sotloff - an American Israeli freelance journalist beheaded in 2014 - struggling to hold back tears on the stand. Arthur Sotloff told the court that the first ransom email he received from the kidnappers described his son as having played a prominent role in \"the US government's battle for the hearts and minds of Muslims\". In the note, the hostage takers called for the release of \"all Muslim people imprisoned directly or indirectly by Americans\" in return for the junior Sotloff's return. Arthur said he had no choice but to keep quiet as the group had demanded media silence. The Sotloffs too sent a video message to their child's captors, playing to their supposed piety by stating that Islam is a merciful religion and the Prophet Muhammad would want them to act differently. Months later, they heard their son's voice for the last time. In an apparently coerced recording, Mr Sotloff asked his family to fight for him and said \"my life lies in the hands of President Obama\". On 3 September 2014, Arthur found out by a news alert that his son had been executed in a publicly released video. He was visibly shaking when he walked off the stand and was comforted by Ms Mueller's father as they left the court. A day earlier, James Foley's mother had testified that she had at first hoped reports her son had been executed were \"some cruel joke\". She told the court: \"It just seemed too horrific.\" Mrs Foley said it only sank in when President Barack Obama confirmed on television that James had been executed. The Elsheikh trial continues and is expected to last three to four weeks.

Mohammed al-Qahtani, 46, was repatriated to Saudi Arabia after a review board determined that he no longer posed a \"significant threat\". The board noted his \"significantly compromised mental health condition\". Qahtani was tortured so badly by US interrogators after his detention in 2001 that he could not be put on trial. The review board said last month that a condition for his transfer should be his participation in Saudi Arabia's rehabilitation centre for jihadists, known as the Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef Centre for Counselling and Care, where he could receive comprehensive mental health care. US authorities have alleged that Qahtani was meant to be on board United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania after being hijacked by four al-Qaeda militants on 9/11. However, he had been prevented from entering the US the previous month. Qahtani was captured four months later on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and brought to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba in February 2002. Investigators there received approval to use \"more aggressive interrogation techniques\" on Qahtani after he resisted conventional methods. Between November 2002 and January 2003, he was subjected to prolonged isolation, sleep deprivation, sexual humiliation and exposure to cold. In 2009, a top official in then-President George W Bush's administration, Susan Crawford, told the Washington Post that Qahtani's treatment \"met the legal definition of torture\" and that she had decided to not refer him for prosecution as a consequence. \"This was not any one particular act; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him, that hurt his health. It was abusive and uncalled for. And coercive,\" she said. A psychiatrist hired by Qahtani's lawyers told a US court that the torture had aggravated a childhood brain injury and schizophrenia that he developed as an adolescent, according to the New York Times. The newspaper also cited court documents as saying that Qahtani had refused psychotropic medication and repeatedly tried to kill himself in recent years. The defence department said 38 detainees remained at Guantanamo following Qahtani's release. Nineteen are eligible for transfer, while 10 others are awaiting trial by military commissions, including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

The first arrivals since Russia's war began were shown wearing bright yellow suits with blue trimmings. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their fellow American, Russian and German crew. \"Sometimes yellow is just yellow,\" said the Roscosmos space agency. The ISS is a joint project between Russia, America, Canada, Japan and several European countries. It is led by a US-Russian partnership that has continued for two decades despite fluctuating tensions between the two world powers. Russian cosmonauts Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov docked at the ISS after a three-hour flight which blasted off from a Russian-owned facility in Kazakhstan. \"Congratulations on the successful docking,\" a voice from Russia's mission control said. A few hours later, two sets of hatches were opened and the three smiling men floated into the space station one by one in their yellow suits. The standard-issue Russian uniform is plain blue, and at least one of the men was seen wearing this before take-off. The moment was live-streamed by both Roscosmos and Nasa, the American space agency. \"It became our turn to pick a colour,\" Mr Artemyev said when he was asked about the suits in a live-streamed press conference. \"We had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it,\" he joked. \"That's why we had to wear yellow.\" Since the invasion of Ukraine, people around the world have used the colours of its national flag to show solidarity and support. But Roscosmos's press service dismissed the reports as a \"funny invention\" by foreign bloggers and media. \"The flight suits of the new crew are made in the colours of the emblem of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from... To see the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is crazy.\" The head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, is a strong supporter of the invasion and he suggested the claims that the cosmonauts were wearing Ukrainian colours had come from Ukrainian nationalists. Roscosmos later published another picture of Oleg Artemyev wearing an obviously Russian suit. The three Russians will begin a science mission on the ISS that is set to last just over six months. They will replace three current crew members who are scheduled to fly back to Earth on 30 March. The colours certainly speak to the moment, but what is the real motivation in wearing them? Does it signal support for Ukraine or the opposite? After all, the suits do display Russian flags. Perhaps neither view is correct. It has been suggested that the colours are a reflection of the fact that all three cosmonauts attended the Bauman Moscow State Technical University which has a similar colour scheme.  It's a \"Bauman crew\", the university has been trumpeting. The cosmonauts themselves, however, said noticeably little. What we do know is that 400km (248 miles) above the Earth, East and West have no choice but to continue friendly relations. While space co-operation is falling apart elsewhere - witness the ExoMars rover, for example - on the ISS the partners are joined at the hip. Russia provides the propulsion for the station, the Americans provide the power. The ISS cannot exist without either party. Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed? Russians grieve for fallen soldiers Putin has redrawn the world - but not the way he wanted\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Anytime it does something that I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t feel is safe, I will take control of the car,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he says. But the reassurances haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t eased his wife\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerns. She says the technology is often jarring and anxiety-inducing. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m reading, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s when I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Oh good grief,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sadie Krueger told CNN Business. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt would be jerky or swerve just out of the blue. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Whoa, are you drunk?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Krueger says she loves their Tesla Model 3, but she feels that \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 drives closer to large trucks than most drivers, and sometimes steers into the wrong lane. The technology drives like a \u201a\u00c4\u00fagrandpa\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in some cases, irritating nearby drivers, she says, but other times can be aggressive. Tesla enthusiasts with the unfinished, test version of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 currently a driver-assist system akin to an enhanced cruise control, are finding that family and friends like Krueger don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always share their enthusiasm. The technology promises to one day drive passengers to their destinations without human intervention. Many tell CNN Business that they use the software less when driving with other people, including their romantic partners. Passengers sometimes object to what they describe as the jerky driving style of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and have asked the Tesla fans not to use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in the vehicle. Some Tesla owners are preemptively deciding to not turn on \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 so that passengers get a smoother ride. Krueger said she humors her husband, as he gets a kick out of testing the software near their California home. His YouTube channel has more than 42,000 subscribers who watch his videos on Tesla. But she draws a line, too, and has asked him not to use it when she rides with him in cities or where he knows it is likely to be jerky. But plenty of passengers, especially younger ones like Krueger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s teenage son, and tech junkies, are excited by the nascent technology, and savor the experience, flaws and all. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s said that lives will be transformed with safer roads and affordable transportation. Musk has described Teslas as \u201a\u00c4\u00faappreciating assets\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that should be worth as much as $200,000, and claims they could someday bring in up to $30,000 in gross profit as robotaxis in the automaker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposed future ridehail network. In Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pitch, robotaxis would operate like Uber or Lyft vehicles that could be summoned via a Tesla smartphone app. There would be no human driver behind the wheel. There might not even be a steering wheel or pedals in the vehicle. Some Tesla enthusiasts have purchased their vehicles with plans to use them as robotaxis in the future. But before Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s technology can change the world, it will first have to work, and then it will have to win over fans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 loved ones. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the reactions of family and friends of its beta testers. Tesla first released an early version of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to a small group in October 2021. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t really \u201a\u00c4\u00faself-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the eyes of regulators and autonomous vehicle experts. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s more like an enhanced cruise control that steers, accelerates and navigates intersections, but it needs an attentive human driver behind the wheel who can take control at any moment because of the system\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shortcomings. Drivers reported being both amazed and alarmed by the system, which sometimes shines, and in other cases makes seemingly dangerous decisions. Tesla owner Justin Demaree says he tries to use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as much as possible. He views it as historically significant work. Tesla cars with \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 send driving data back to the automaker, which uses it to refine the software. Demaree imagines a day when people may not even fly anymore because self-driving software gets so good. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt will change everything,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Demaree said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to pay attention, you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to do anything, you can spend that time with family or doing other things that are more productive or add more value.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But Demaree must reckon with the difference between the promised future and the current reality when his family gets in the car. He only uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 about half the time that he drives with his wife Heather. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s being temperamental, she doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to ask anymore,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Demarre said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just turn it off.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Walt Corey, 70, hopes he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll never have to turn off the \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 software while driving alone or with his wife, Nancy. He bought a Tesla in hopes of ensuring their mobility and independence as they age. He says she gets annoyed with the loud alarm that sounds to alert drivers when they need to immediately take control of the car because it can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t handle a situation. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really obnoxious,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Corey said, explaining that the noise bothers him as well. \u201a\u00c4\u00faLet me know if I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m about to drive off the cliff or hit somebody, but don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do it because the software gets confused.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jeff Goin, a pilot and self-described \u201a\u00c4\u00fatechno-geek,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 bought a Tesla in part because he felt that Autopilot, its driver-assist technology that is more rudimentary than \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 would make him feel less fatigued after long drives. Tesla owners generally say that using Autopilot\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s auto-steering function on divided highways leaves them less drained after hours on the road. But Goin doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He tried the software and felt he was having to pay even more attention when using it. Goin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s partner Tim uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 regularly. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHang on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin says he jokes to friends riding with them when Tim turns on \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 When the couple rides by themselves, Tim uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 less. Goin said he sometimes works in the car, so he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t like the distraction of being jostled. Even so, Goin says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s at times impressed with \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSometimes you get in there and you think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s come a long way. And then it stops on the railroad tracks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin said, describing a recent incident in which he says his Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 sensed a stop sign down the road and chose to stop earlier than advisable, briefly stopping on railroad tracks. Goin, who said he \u201a\u00c4\u00faimmensely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 admires CEO Elon Musk, is skeptical of how soon self-driving vehicles will be a reality. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time on the regular scale, minutes on a regular scale and then there are Musk minutes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin said. Though Musk has never wavered in his promise that self-driving Teslas are just around the corner, the challenge of building a fully autonomous vehicle has proven harder than those developing them expected. Building a robotaxi that drives safely isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough, either. Robotaxis will have to operate smoothly enough to make passengers like Goin comfortable. Many of them are unlikely to accept as many flaws as early adopters of technology. John Gibbs, a Georgia professor who says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s long tested beta software, is \u201a\u00c4\u00faused to seeing things break and behave weirdly and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Oh wow, I wonder what caused that,?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut there are people whose personality types are much less that. They just want something to work.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 One of them is Gibbs\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wife, Lane, he said, who doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t like it when full self-driving is jerky in turns. He uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with her on straightaways, but he turns it off at intersections where the car must turn. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFor her comfort and sanity, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve just learned it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not worth having her go, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Why are you doing this?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The group hope to be the first all-black team to climb Mount Everest. The other nine members of the team are Americans. About 6,000 climbers are known to have conquered Everest to date, but fewer than 10 people of African origin are in this exclusive group. The Full Circle Everest team hopes to more than double that number. They have just left base camp and hope to reach the summit in about two months. At 62, Mr Kagambi is the oldest in the team of experienced mountaineers. He has summitted all the highest peaks in Africa, as well as the highest point in four continents, and hopes to become the first African to achieve all seven. He was the first black African to conquer Denali -  the highest peak in North America. \"The main goal of our expedition is to encourage people of colour to go out, to venture into the mountains, so that it's not just white people out there. It is also to show people that they can do it, because there are people who they feel like this is not for us [black people], it is for them,\" he told the BBC before leaving for Nepal. Although many Nepalese and Indians have climbed Everest - often as guides, mountaineering is often seen as a white person's sport, especially in the West - something that Mr Kagambi grapples with in the US as a mountaineering instructor and guide. It comes in the form of clients who don't trust in his skill because of his ethnicity. \"Before people realise what I have done, especially when I meet white people in the US, you see some people hesitating. Until you prove to them that you know what you are doing - that's when they open up. I see that quite a bit,\" he said. The former primary school teacher fell in love with mountains in 1973 when as a teenager he watched in awe from his village at the midnight fireworks on the peak of Mount Kenya as the country celebrated its first decade of independence from British colonial rule. \"That was really unique and I remember saying: 'I wish I can do that.' But I never thought I would.\" Years later, after graduating from a teachers' training college, he made an attempt on Mount Kenya and reached the summit. \"The first time I stepped on the snow, I knew that it's something I really loved doing. And I kept going back and liking it more,\" he said. But his path to scaling Everest has been the steepest. On two previous attempts, being Kenyan was his undoing after American sponsors insisted that beneficiaries must be US residents. \"The last one was very close - like four months before the expedition - that's when I was struck off. That was frustrating but rules have to be followed,\" he said - a glimpse of the stoicism learnt from the mountains and which pervades his speech. Climbing Everest isn't cheap - up to $85,000 (\u00a365,000) - and he had given up trying because age was catching up with him. Then an email in January 2021 from his American friend and fellow mountaineer Philip Henderson changed everything. \"My immediate reaction was that I wouldn't do it. I told him that I'm too old and my knees are already not good on the mountains.\" But Mr Henderson insisted, pointing to reviews from other mountaineers who hailed Mr Kagambi as a guide who was \"encouraging and supportive, especially to women\". Getting admission into the team was the easiest hurdle. Finding sponsors proved the most difficult obstacle, as the traditional way of knocking on corporate doors proved futile. \"The hardest part for me was that I expected to work towards going to Everest in terms of training but I didn't have the facilities and the finance to do that.\" Frustrated, out of funds and with no sponsorship, a breakthrough came through a WhatsApp group of his friends who were raising funds for the expedition. Contributions were trickling in slowly and there was little hope in sight. Then word reached a Kenyan betting firm, which immediately offered a sponsorship deal, which covers Mr Kagambi's training, travel allowance, insurance and operational logistics. Part of his rigorous training regime has included scaling Mount Kenya six times from January to April. That was followed by a two-week expedition on the Rwenzori mountains in neighbouring Uganda. The Full Circle Everest team also met in January for a reconnaissance and team-building session in Nepal. Earlier, from July to December last year he was in the US and carrying 50kg bags while hiking for months and training students. \"I've been on the mountain all the time. Because of my knees, the best thing for me is to be out there hiking as high as I can for training,\" he said. His family is worried about his wellbeing, especially because climbing Mount Everest is such a dangerous undertaking. \"I really hope it goes well because at this point we know there are only two outcomes - it's either he goes and comes back, or he goes and doesn't come back. There's that anxiety, there's that fear, but we don't want to show him,\" his daughter Cynthia said. But Mr Kagambi seems unfazed and defiantly declared that he had done riskier things in his life. He also pointed to his long experience of navigating through snow, glaciers, ice and rocks. \"I'm confident of summitting Mount Everest, but the other thing I say is - I will not put my life at risk to do it. I have done enough mountaineering to know my body. I can assess and tell myself it's time to go back,\" he said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Four journalists have so far been killed reporting on the war and many more are injured or missing. Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna has been missing for more than a week, and her outlet believes she is being held by Russian forces. However, Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief of the Kyiv Independent, said journalist Oleh Baturyn, who was kidnapped last week in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Kakhovka, was just released by Russian fighters. The Kyiv Independent is a fairly new publication but has earned acclaim for its war coverage. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone from being a three-month-old startup and a relative unknown in the Western world to now one of the leading sources of information on the war in Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on Reliable Sources Sunday. Rudenko said no one on her team has been directly targeted yet, but reporting on the conflict is a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadaily risk.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have to remember that this is an invasion by an authoritarian regime that has been targeting journalists and media consistently for decades now,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rudenko said. Rudenko said the outlet is learning as they go when it comes to protecting employees who have suddenly found themselves war correspondents. Several of the Independent\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reporters already had experience working in a war zone following Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Now they are once again working in dangerous locations, including Kyiv. One of the outlet\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s biggest fears is that Russian forces may cut off internet connections, hindering their ability to publish news. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe do not concentrate\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in one place, Rudenko said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are in different locations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Work goes on, but there is an emphasis on avoiding unnecessary risks. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are also telling reporters that safety is a priority,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rudenko said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo story is worth a human life.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But the psychological impacts will last after the war, Rudenko said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faJust being thrown into this,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rudenko said of the toll the fighting is taking. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis new reality where we cover this horror every day and every hour.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Jones is co-author of \u201a\u00c4\u00faSay it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 900AM WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN. Tiger Woods had already won the minute he walked onto that fairway at the 86th Masters golf tournament on Thursday and, for me, he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t need a sixth green jacket prize to prove it. It was just over a year ago when the world was stunned by the news that Woods had been in a horrible car accident in Los Angeles. Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 right leg nearly had to be amputated but was saved by emergency surgery. Afterward, many wondered whether Woods ever walk again, let alone play golf. This year, 2022, is the Year of the Tiger \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a year that signifies courage, bravery and resilience. And just perhaps, Woods had a feeling his fate would change this year, as he tweeted: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHappy Year of the Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 back in January. No one but Tiger could have imagined that just 14 months after his accident, the Hall of Fame golfer would be out of his wheelchair and competing in golf\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most prestigious tournament. Sometimes, winning isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t about trophies. It is about refusing to be defeated by adversity. Refusing to give in to hopelessness. Winning looks like Tiger Woods, battered but far from broken. Doctor: 'On paper' Tiger Woods shouldn't be able to play the Masters Personally, I feel connected to Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s journey back. As a young girl, a car accident left me bedridden and unable to walk for more than a year. Doctors told my mother I might not walk again \u201a\u00c4\u00ec but I was determined to prove them wrong. It was not easy. I leaned on my childlike faith, believing God would make me strong again. And I pushed through rehab \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and the hurtful taunts from neighborhood kids. Unlike Tiger, my dreams were small: learn to walk again, make the track team, become a cheerleader. I accomplished all three. Since then, anyone who has tried to limit my dreams gets the side-eye. Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 miraculous comeback reminds me of the lesson I learned early on: no one has power over me unless I allow it. On Thursday, Woods did not win the first round but he did remarkably well. He finished the opening round at 71, 1 under par. He was four strokes behind the leader, South Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Sungjae Im. Still, as we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve seen so many times, even when Woods is not winning, he elevates the game and everything around it, as evidenced by the huge crowds and intense media buzz in Augusta, Georgia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s definitely a different feel in tournaments that he tees it up in,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 golfer Patrick Cantlay, told Sky Sports. What Tiger Woods's close call makes clear They call it the \u201a\u00c4\u00faTiger Effect.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 And it has forever changed the way we see the game of golf. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s difficult to describe the impact Woods has had on the sport since his first Masters win in 1997, when he blew past his nearest competitor by a whopping 12 strokes \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a record at the time. Woods was just 21 years old. Since then, Woods has collected 82 PGA Tour wins, including 15 majors. His last big win came at his most recent major, the 2019 Masters, finishing 13 under par \u201a\u00c4\u00ec just after his fourth back surgery and fifth knee surgery. On top of all the wins, Woods became a cultural icon \u201a\u00c4\u00ec one of Madison Avenue\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hottest pitchmen \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and in the process, transformed his sport. Golf was no longer your father\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s or grandfather\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s game. Gone were the days of watching aging, mostly White men wearing \u201a\u00c4\u00fadad\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shorts, putting balls over their ever-expanding bellies. Fiji\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Vijay Singh, who won the Masters in 2000, was the one of the only nonwhite golfers on the pro tour back then. Tiger made golf cool for younger generations. And all around the world, young and not-so-young Tiger-wannabes started sprouting up, especially among Black and brown players. Everyone, men and women, and children dreamed of playing like Tiger. Can Tiger Woods win the Masters? Hear what CNN reporter thinks It should be noted that history was made on Thursday, for the first time in 86 years at the Masters, we saw three Black golfers in tournament \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Harold Varner III, Cameron Champ and Woods. Both Varner and Champ grew up idolizing Tiger. Tony Finau, who is of Tongan and Somoan descent, also played. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI dreamed since I was a kid of competing against Tiger, playing against him at the Masters \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what my dreams were made of as a kid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finau told golf.com about the first time he played with Woods, back in 2019 at the Masters. Finau said he picked up his first golf clubs in 1997 after watching Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s historic win in Augusta. In golf, there is Before Tiger and After Tiger. Before Tiger, most sports fans and sports reporters argued over whether golf was even a real sport. Most agreed, it was not. But then along came Woods, bringing his game of power and distance, smashing golf balls, talking about training regimens and weight lifting workouts. Woods dominated his competitors so completely that suddenly golf courses were being redesigned or as some put it, \u201a\u00c4\u00faTiger proofed.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Tiger Woods: Five-time Masters winner shoots one-under 71 in first round after return from injury Most golf courses were lengthened by thousands of feet to try to level the playing field \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Woods and his power game had made old course designs too easy. Golf became a game built for strong, young players in top condition. And any pro golfer who couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t keep up with the Tiger proofing, quickly fell out of contention. Woods turned golf into a spectator sport, and now, when he plays, television ratings spike. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s why media outlets began jockeying for rights to broadcast golf majors and advertisers clamored for buy-in. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also changed the game in other ways. Back in 1997, Woods won the Masters and took home $486,000 from the total shared prize fund of $2.7 million. Just before the pandemic hit in 2019, Wood\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Master\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s win topped $2 million, out of a total record-breaking prize fund of $11.5 million. (This year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s prize money is expected to be the same as 2019). Woods has made the men around him millionaires. Before his rise, there were fewer than 10 golfers who earned more than a million dollars. But by 2018, more than 100 players were topping the million-dollar mark. By 2009, Woods had become the first-ever billion-dollar athlete, topping his good friend Michael Jordan. A look back at Tiger Woods' triumph, tragedy and trauma Nike and other brands have made a fortune designing updated golf clubs and other merchandise for the game, including more fashionable golf wear featuring body hugging, Tiger-red colored shirts and pleated black pants for golfers. (Nike even had a rule no other golfer could wear Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s colors on game day.) No matter how you feel about Woods, the Tiger Effect is real. But not everyone has relished Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rise. Beneath all the accolades and big money, there have always been grumblings, mostly from old-school golfers and fans who resented all the changes and fanfare. Many felt the felt the power game pushed out skilled golfers with less strength. In addition, Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 prominence put the spotlight on a sport that was found lacking \u201a\u00c4\u00ec especially when it came to diversity and the systemic racism and sexism in the game at every level. Thankfully, The Tiger Effect has helped to knock down many of those barriers. But there is still much room for improvement. Watching Woods now, it is bittersweet for fans like me to acknowledge that some of his greatest contributions to the game \u201a\u00c4\u00ec power and athleticism \u201a\u00c4\u00ec now make it nearly impossible for him to dominate as once did. Sign up for CNN Opinion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Because of Tiger, today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s game is about power and distance. It rewards younger, stronger, athletes in top condition. And at 46 years old \u201a\u00c4\u00ecyoung by any measure except in professional sports \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it is unreasonable to expect Woods to intimidate and dominate. His legacy has brought other formidable power players into the game, like 23-year-old Joaquin Niemann from Chile. And now it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Niemann and younger players like him who are smashing balls and winning championships. One day, hopefully no time soon, Tiger will walk away, leaving the game of golf far better than it was when he found it. And until then, golf will continue to ride the Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wave. In the end, Tiger Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 legacy will be bigger than green jackets and golf trophies. For me it will be a story of resilience, dedication and the courage to fight for your dreams.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

The regulation on so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00faghost guns\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec unregulated, untraceable weapons made from kits \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will address a critical gap in the government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to track them by requiring background checks before purchase and serial numbers on some of the components. Though ghost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement, they have been seen with increasing frequency in recent years. Biden brought one of the kits to the Rose Garden on Monday, declaring the new rules \u201a\u00c4\u00fabasic common sense\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 before holding aloft one of the weapons made from the gear. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you buy a couch you have to assemble, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still a couch. If you order a package like this one over here that includes that parts that you need and directs the assembly of a functioning firearm, you bought a gun,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he declared, striding over to the kit and demonstrating the ease of constructing the weapon. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t take very long,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnyone can order it in the mail.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden also named Steve Dettelbach, a former US attorney from Ohio, as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s previous nominee was forced to withdraw amid opposition in the Senate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis mission of this agency isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t controversial \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s public safety,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said. What you should know about ghost guns, ahead of Biden's expected announcement on new regulations The moves came as gun violence and crime have ticked up in the United States, putting pressure on the White House to take action. A rash of shootings over the weekend underscored the emergency: Four people, including two teens, were shot shortly after a Major League Baseball game in Washington, DC, on Saturday night, police said. In Illinois, six people were found injured after a shooting occurred in a residential neighborhood. Police are also investigating a shooting at a birthday party in Indianapolis where six people were shot and one person was killed. And two people were also killed and 10 hospitalized after a \u201a\u00c4\u00fatargeted attack\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 at a Cedar Rapids nightclub, police say. Routine deadly gun violence is a uniquely American problem. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed gun violence a \u201a\u00c4\u00faserious public health threat\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 last year. Biden has made modest progress on gun control, but major steps like banning assault weapons or closing background check loopholes would require congressional action. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNone of this absolves Congress \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 for the responsibility to act,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said. Gun violence traditionally spikes in the summer months, lending further urgency to Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s actions. The new rule issued by the Justice Department seeks to rein in a type of weapon that has been seen more and more at crime scenes across the country. Ghost gun kits can be purchased online, and a weapon can be self-manufactured in as little as 30 minutes. Because regulators cannot trace them, ghost guns are appealing to criminals and those with criminal histories, according to officials. The new rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check, as is required for other types of firearm purchases. It also requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number, so the eventual weapon produced can be traced. And it mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to already built ghost guns they come across in their businesses. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAll of a sudden, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no longer a ghost,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said of the new rules. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt has a return address. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to help save lives, reduce crime and get more criminals off the streets.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faGhost guns look like a gun, they shoot like a gun, and they kill like a gun, but up until now they haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been regulated like a gun,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement celebrating the Biden administration for \u201a\u00c4\u00fadoubling down on its commitment to gun safety.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Mia Tretta, who was shot and wounded with a ghost gun in a school shooting in California in 2019, similarly praised the administration for taking \u201a\u00c4\u00faa critical step\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the new regulation. Tretta introduced the President in the Rose Garden on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you can put together an IKEA dresser, you can build a ghost gun,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in a statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUnfortunately, it is that easy to get a weapon that has not only changed my life but has done the same thing to thousands of others. Finalizing this rule is a critical step to making sure no one else has to go through what my family has had to go through.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Justice Department previously launched a national ghost gun enforcement initiative, which will \u201a\u00c4\u00fatrain a national cadre of prosecutors and disseminate investigation and prosecution tools to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the White House. Biden said Monday that those who commit a crime using a ghost gun should \u201a\u00c4\u00faexpect federal prosecution.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis rule is an important step. It is going to make a difference, I promise you,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said. Ghost guns have been used in multiple recent shootings, including at a Maryland high school in January. The exact number in circulation is unknowable, given the inability of regulators to track them. Between 2016 and 2021, the ATF received 45,000 reports of privately made firearms recovered by law enforcement, including 692 from homicides or attempted homicides. The agency was able to trace only 1% of them, officials said, because the firearms lack serial numbers. Maryland joins 10 states and DC becoming latest to place restrictions on ghost guns Multiple states have moved to restrict their sale as ghost guns become more common at crime scenes. Last week, Maryland joined Washington, DC, and 10 other states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in banning or restricting the purchase or use of ghost guns, which are often bought online and assembled at home. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer again decried the use of ghost guns during a press conference Sunday, calling for a crackdown on the rise of the privately made firearms and speaking about a deadly shooting in the Bronx Friday. The New York Democrat blamed Republicans for holding up gun reform legislation, while pressing Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration to go further. \u201a\u00c4\u00faToday I am calling on the administration to go all after ghost guns, by putting out regulations that will stop them. The federal government has the ability through regulation to stop these ghost guns,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Still, Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s planned firearm regulation drew backlash from gun rights advocates even before being officially announced. Aidan Johnston, the director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, said in a statement Sunday, \u201a\u00c4\u00faBiden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal to create a comprehensive national gun registry and end the online sale of gun parts without the passage of a new law exemplifies his disregard for the Second Amendment.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In September, Biden withdrew his nomination of David Chipman to lead the ATF after facing opposition from Republicans and certain moderate Democrats. Chipman, a former career official at ATF, came under scrutiny from gun rights supporters and the National Rifle Association for his work as a senior adviser to Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the organization started by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at an event in her Arizona district in 2011. Dettelbach ran unsuccessfully for Ohio attorney general in 2018 after serving as US attorney in the state. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will be working hard to ensure that Steve Dettelbach receives the fair hearing and confirmation that he deserves. He should be a noncontroversial candidate because he has a long record of working in law enforcement and for the public safety of the people of Ohio and the American people,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 one of the officials said.

The decision, which was first reported by The Blast, comes days after West, who now goes by Ye, was temporarily banned from Instagram after using a racial slur directed at \u201a\u00c4\u00faDaily Show\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 host Trevor Noah. Noah is also the host of next month\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Grammy Awards. West\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s derogatory social media post was in response to Noah expressing concern over the artist\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recent treatment of his former wife Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, \u201a\u00c4\u00faSNL\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 star Pete Davidson during an episode of his show last week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou may not feel sorry for Kim because she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rich and famous,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Noah said in the segment. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut what she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going through is terrifying to watch and shines a spotlight on what so many women go through when they choose to leave.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 A source close to Noah told CNN that he had nothing to do with West\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance being canceled and that he has not had any conversations with producers or the Recording Academy, who produces the show, about West. \u201a\u00c4\u00faTrevor never asked the Grammys to ban Kanye from performing. He was not offended by Kanye\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Instagram post and Trevor responded on Instagram. The notion that Trevor or his team asked the Grammys to ban Kanye is ridiculous,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the source said. CNN has not yet received comment from the Recording Academy and West has not commented publicly. West is nominated for five Grammys this year, including album of the year. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unclear if he plans to attend the ceremony. Noah commented on West\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Instagram post, which has since been deleted, a message of support to the musician, writing it \u201a\u00c4\u00fabreaks my heart to see you like this,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and that his music had been an \u201a\u00c4\u00faindelible\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 part of his life.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Early Sunday morning Noah tweeted, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI said counsel Kanye not cancel Kanye.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The news of West\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s performance being axed from this year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lineup came as a bit of a surprise to his fans considering he had not been among the first round of performers announced last week for the 64th Grammy Awards. More performances will be announced in the days leading up to the show. Among the artists who are set to take the stage are Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X, BTS and Olivia Rodrigo.

The discovery of a wild-born Eastern indigo snake marks the success of an intensive program to reintroduce the reptiles to the state. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe snake found yesterday indicates the project is resulting in some thriving and reproducing indigos, just what we wanted!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division said Thursday on Facebook. \u201a\u00c4\u00faReintroducing a species to its native range is a daunting task, and we celebrate each step of its success!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The reptile, which is the largest snake native to the US, used to be found throughout Alabama. But they went extinct in the state in the 1950s, largely due to habitat loss, according to the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The snakes, however, are a crucial element of the ecosystem. Jim Godwin, an animal biologist with the Alabama Natural Heritage Program administered by the Auburn University Museum of Natural History, told CNN that Eastern indigo snakes were historically the \u201a\u00c4\u00faapex predator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the longleaf pine forests where they live. A decline in the snake\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s population, therefore, has a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadomino effect\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on other species in the ecosystem. So in 2006, a team of Alabama conservationists launched a project to reintroduce the Eastern indigo snake to the state. Starting with wild-captured individuals from Georgia, where the snakes are also found, they began to breed a captive population. In 2010, the first snakes from the captive population were released into Conecuh National Forest. The goal is to eventually introduce a total of 300 snakes to create a healthy and viable population in Alabama. The discovery of wild-born Eastern indigo snakes means the released snakes survived and had offspring, providing a glimpse of hope for the species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 success in Alabama. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is an excellent indicator that the snakes that we have released, which were born into captivity, have been able to adapt to the wild, are functioning as wild snakes, and are reproducing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Godwin. The snake discovered was clearly wild-born due to two factors, according to Godwin: its small size and its lack of a PIT (or passive integrated transponder) tag. The hatchling was clearly smaller than those released from captivity, which were usually at least two feet long; the snakes can grow up to eight feet long in adulthood. And the released snakes are tagged with PIT tags, which have small microchips allowing researchers to identify each animal by its unique code. The first wild-born Eastern indigo snake was discovered in Alabama in 2020, according to the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Both snakes were actually found by accident, according to Godwin, who explained \u201a\u00c4\u00fait\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s difficult to just go out and do a search for them, because they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re small, and they can hide very easily.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 During the winter, the project team monitors the burrows of gopher tortoises, where the adult Eastern indigo snakes breed in the colder months, in hopes of identifying the animals. The reintroduction project has been an ongoing collaboration between Auburn University, the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the US Forest Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and other partners, Godwin said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The organizer of a Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT) meeting at the University of North Texas (UNT) says campus police escorted her into a janitor's closet for her own safety after activists disrupted the event featuring Texas House of Representatives candidate Jeff Younger. Younger is the father of a 7-year-old child, who was born James but now goes by Luna, at the center of a 2019 custody battle that attracted national attention\u00a0after his mother encouraged the boy to medically transition into a girl. A Texas judge granted Younger's ex-wife full custody of the child and a sibling in 2019. \"We actually had invited guests for all of our general biweekly meetings. We looked at local political candidates, we looked at local, conservative YouTubers. \u2026 We were just looking at anyone who'd be interesting and who was nearby,\" Kelly Neidert, a 22-year-old senior at UNT and founder of the school's registered YCT chapter, told Fox News Digital. University of North Texas (Google Maps) \"We had heard of Jeff [Younger] before and found out he was actually running for a House district, so we just thought: he has this backstory. He's also running for an election. So he seemed like a good fit, and he was willing to come in,\" she continued. ANTIFA PROTESTERS DISRUPT TEXAS COLLEGE CAMPUS PRO-LIFE PRAYER VIGIL: \u2018F--- YOUR GOD!\u2019 But the March 2 event featuring the conservative congressional candidate and critic of transgender ideology turned into chaos when dozens of activists showed up to the event and scared away other non-disruptive students, Neidert said, adding that about 70% of the 80 attendees \u2014 the maximum capacity \u2014 in the classroom were protesters. Videos posted to Neidert's Twitter and TikTok accounts show protesters screaming, talking over speakers, drawing on a whiteboard in the classroom and taking other disruptive actions. In one video, Younger laughs as one protester screams while he is speaking. About 40 minutes into the meeting, Neidert said things got so chaotic that campus police had to help her and a fellow YCT member exit the room. Once they left the building, they were met with more protesters waiting outside who attempted to follow Neidert and the other YCT member, the 22-year-old said. Officers escorted Neidert\u00a0to a janitor's closet inside another building until eventually leading her back outside and into a police vehicle. TEXAS PROFESSOR SUES UNIVERSITY AFTER BEING PUNISHED FOR SAYING MUSIC THEORY ISN'T RACIST Neidert\u00a0said she had already coordinated with police prior to the event because she had been receiving \"death threats and threats of violence\" at school prior to the event. In a March 3 statement, UNT President Neal Smatresk said campus police bolstered security for the event ahead of time \"[b]ecause conversations surrounding the student organization\u2019s event, which focused on criminalizing healthcare for transgender children, have been contentious,\" adding that \"a few hundred protesters\" had gathered outside the building where the meeting was held since the event was limited to 80 attendees. He added that police \"believe a small group of protestors not affiliated with the university contributed to escalating the overall protest from peaceful to an aggressive encounter.\" \"A group of protestors surrounded the police vehicles containing both the student organizers and their guest and attempted to block their exit from the scene by banging on the vehicles and impeding their movement,\" Smatresk\u00a0said. \"The officers engaged emergency lights and sounded warning sirens repeatedly while inching forward as other officers assisted in clearing a path for the vehicles to exit safely.\" He continued: \"We have always touted the importance of freedom of expression and been proud of our students\u2019 ability to speak up for themselves and participate in nonviolent protest. UNT Police have continuously worked to create and maintain an environment safe for all students to express themselves, regardless of topic.\" The incident did not result in any injuries, according to the school president. It's not the first time activists have come to YCT events on campus and tried to \"down out\" speakers by making noise, Neidert\u00a0explained, but it is the first time she was ever escorted into a janitor's closet for her own safety.

Neidert has received some harassment since the event, \"but nothing too serious.\" \"People have been flipping me off and yelling rude things more than usual, but I haven't felt unsafe,\" she said. \"I do have a group of friends from my Young Conservatives of Texas chapter who are helping me deal with this, and they have also been walking around campus with me so I'm not alone.

The question now is what Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which he followed up by calling Putin a \u201a\u00c4\u00famurderous dictator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapure thug\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will mean for the war in Ukraine going forward. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t signal any concern that Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks would roil talks with Russia. He told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Fareed Zakaria that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faready for negotiations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with Putin. (More on this in a minute.) Biden's strategy with Putin is decades in the making Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments represented a major moment since leading officials had mostly avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. But soon after the President uttered the words \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think he is a war criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to reporters at an unrelated event, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the comment was \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom the heart.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Other officials used similar language. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hard not to walk away with that conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 State Department spokesman Ned Price later told CNN. And after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he \u201a\u00c4\u00fapersonally\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 agreed with Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s label of Putin, Psaki told reporters that the top US diplomat was speaking from the heart \u201a\u00c4\u00faas well.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Why all the parsing? While terms like \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar crimes\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are often used colloquially, they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Conventions, which specify intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime. In other words, the White House is being careful to not get ahead of the international investigations probing Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Will Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s words complicate Ukraine-Russia negotiations? The Kremlin called Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks about Putin being a war criminal \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Asked if it would be hard to sit down with Putin, Zelensky maintained Sunday that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ready \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and has been ready. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout delay,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 warning that otherwise Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s losses would be \u201a\u00c4\u00fahuge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The problem, as CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security team reports, is that US and NATO officials believe Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s engagement truly is \u201a\u00c4\u00ec even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Everything you need to know about war crimes and how Putin could be prosecuted The view from the State Department. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday also expressed her personal view that war crimes are being committed in Russia, saying that they \u201a\u00c4\u00faall feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but noted that there must be \u201a\u00c4\u00faa body of proof\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 before a legal determination can be made. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there is virtually no one \u201a\u00c4\u00ec maybe Vladimir Putin is the exception \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who can look at all of the photographs, all of video coming from Ukraine and not believe that Putin is intentionally targeting civilians, and intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in an interview with CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s John Berman on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow, I think we all feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sherman said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in terms of international law, you have to have evidence, you have to have a body of proof that in fact there was intentionality.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added that the United States is \u201a\u00c4\u00fahelping to pull that evidence together, present it to international justice parties and then have a legal threshold that is met.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 How long do war crime investigations take? Investigations at the International Criminal Court take many years, and only a handful of convictions have ever been won. Put differently, it could be a while before Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 remarks have any legal weight \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if ever. As we noted earlier this month, the court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia. That seems unlikely.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Earlier this week, a ProPublica report revealed Mr Thomas failed to disclose trips he took with real estate mogul Harlan Crow almost every year over the course of two decades, despite being required to file annual disclosures of gifts. In a statement on Friday, Mr Thomas said that he had been told by colleagues and others that \"this sort of personal hospitality\" did not need to be formally disclosed. Mr Thomas is one of nine justices on the Supreme Court serving lifetime appointments after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. Here is a look at the conservative justice and his eight colleagues who sit on the bench, including the Supreme Court's most recent member, Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal chosen by President Joe Biden last year. Jackson's appointment has not altered the 6-3 conservative majority on the court. On the court since: 23 October 1991 How he got to the court: Thomas was born in a small town in Georgia, and was one of the few African-Americans in attendance during a short stint in seminary and then at Holy Cross College. But unlike Justice Sotomayor, those experiences made him distrustful of affirmative action policies. After finishing Yale Law, he worked in Missouri government and in Washington DC before being named chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency that responds to discrimination claims in the workplace. After a bruising confirmation hearing - in which a former employee accused him of sexual harassment - Thomas was narrowly confirmed to Supreme Court, at the relatively young age of 43. Who is he as a justice? Thomas' originalism is exacting, including a disregard for stare decisis, respect for prior court rulings and precedence. Thomas has also not asked a question during oral arguments in nine years. He has previously said he doesn't care for the question-heavy arguments, sometimes already drafting opinions based on written briefs before any lawyer gets up to argue. Thomas often files entirely separate dissents rarely joined by others, but Coyle says he is influential in other ways, including during conferences only justices attend, and in \"difficult decisions\" in areas that don't get a lot of press - like intellectual property and tax law. Thomas replaced the first African-American justice on the court - Thurgood Marshall. On the court since: 3 October 2022 How she got to the court: The first black woman to sit on the court in its 233-year history is also the first justice since 1967 to come to the court with extensive experience as a criminal defence attorney. Before the US Supreme Court, the Washington DC native served on the influential US court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. Ms Jackson has said she has a \"methodology\" to deciding cases but not an overarching philosophy.\u00a0Some conservatives have accused her of being \"soft\" on criminals, pointing to her experience as a public defender and willingness as a federal judge to issue prison sentences below federal guidelines. Her confirmation came after President Biden pledged during his presidential campaign to appoint a black woman to the top court. On the court since: 31 January 2006 How he got to the court: Alito grew up in New Jersey in an Italian immigrant family. While at Princeton University, he was involved in conservative and libertarian groups, as well as the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps. After Yale law school, he was a prosecutor in New Jersey and served in the Reagan administration in the justice department, including as assistant to the solicitor general, where he argued before the Supreme Court. President George HW Bush named him to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1990, where he stayed until his nomination to The Supreme Court. Who is he as a justice? Alito is a conservative justice, but one who does not hew as often to originalism as fellow conservatives Scalia and Thomas. He is not always talkative in oral arguments  but his questions are sharp, aiming to pick apart an argument's logic. Alito has a low public profile despite being a large part of the court's rightward shift on business, campaign finance and racial issues over the past decade. The former prosecutor has been \"very pro-government\" in criminal cases, Coyle says, and has shown less willingness than his conservative colleagues to protect free speech in cases where it is harmful or hateful. On the court since: 7 August 2010 How she got to the court: Kagan grew up in New York City. At the age of 12, she convinced her rabbi to hold the synagogue's first formal bat mitzvah, the rite of passage for young women. After law school at Harvard, she clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. After a successful stint as the first female dean of Harvard Law School, she was briefly US solicitor general - the federal government's top representative at the US Supreme Court, before being nominated by President Barack Obama for the high court. Who is she as a justice? Kagan is the first justice in decades not to previously serve as a judge. She is part of the court's left-leaning wing, but has been the author of many of recent unanimous or near unanimous decisions. Her writing is often easy for a layperson to understand without sacrificing legal analysis, and she is an aggressive questioner during oral arguments. Kagan first took her seat at the bench at the age of 50 and could potentially be a force on the court for decades. Lithwick says Kagan is \"much more inscrutable\" on issues than other recent additions to the court. \"She's very close to the vest,\" she says. On the court since: 29 September 2005 How he got to the court: Born in New York and raised in Indiana, Roberts attended a boarding school as a teenager but also spent summers working in a steel mill. After considering becoming a historian at Harvard, he went to law school there instead, eventually clerking for then-Associate Justice Rehnquist. He spent many years as a lawyer in the Reagan administration then entered private practice, arguing before the high court and serving as one of several legal advisers to George W Bush in the Florida presidential recount case. Originally nominated to fill the spot left by retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Roberts was re-nominated for the chief justice position after Chief Justice Rehnquist died between terms, and his nomination was fast-tracked. Who is he as a justice: A conservative justice, Roberts is the third-youngest Chief Justice in the court's history, confirmed at 50 years old. Last year's term saw more than half its cases decided unanimously, something many court watchers cite as the outcome of Roberts' desire to foster agreement through narrower rulings. He also notably wrote the 5-4 opinion that shot down a major challenge to President Barack Obama's healthcare law. \"I think he cares deeply about how the 'Roberts court' looks,\" Lithwick says, and knows he can move the court slowly over decades. \"He doesn't want huge swings, except in areas he feels very strongly about,\" Coyle says, like government's role in racial issues, campaign finance's relation to free speech and the structure of constitution. Roberts also looks to keep decorum on the bench during oral arguments. On the court since: 8 August 2009 How she got to the court: Sotomayor was born to Puerto Rican parents in the Bronx. As a student at Princeton University, she fought for hiring more Latino professors and admitting more Latino students. After Yale Law school, she became a prosecutor in New York and was later named to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal appeals courts are often the final step before the Supreme Court for cases. In the second circuit, Sotomayor authored more than 150 majority opinions - including a few that were ultimately overruled by the higher court. Who is she as a justice? Sotomayor is the first Hispanic justice. She's also been one of the most public facing - her memoir appeared on the New York Times' best-selling list, she appeared twice on Sesame Street, once to adjudicate a dispute between Goldilocks and Baby Bear, and she helped drop the ball in Times Square on New Year's Eve 2013.  \"She's trying really hard to demystify the court, showing 'You can be a justice too',\" Lithwick says. Her former experience as a prosecutor and trial judge often leads her to challenge lawyers on the facts of a case, says Marcia Coyle, the chief Washington correspondent for the National Law Journal. \"She knows how criminal trials operate,\" Coyle says. On the court since: 10 April 2017 How he got to the court: At 49, Gorsuch was the youngest nominee in a quarter of a century when he was approved in 2017. The Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. He began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, and worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Who is he as a justice? Gorsuch succeeded the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and was welcomed by conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law. In his first year on the court he has cemented the 5-4 conservative advantage, and that's been seen in a series of rulings on contentious issues such as the Trump travel ban, trade union fees and gerrymandering. On the court since: 6 October 2018 How he got to the court: Kavanaugh served on the influential Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit and was formerly a White House aide under George W Bush. He previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. His confirmation process was one of the most controversial in recent years amid allegations of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, which he denied. After a hearing in which one of his accusers gave a dramatic testimony of the alleged incident and Kavanaugh fiercely defended his record, he was approved by the Senate by 50-48. Born in Washington, DC in 1965, Kavanaugh studied at Georgetown Preparatory School an all-boys school in Bethesda, Maryland, and graduated from Yale College and Yale Law School. Who is he as a justice? He succeeded Anthony Kennedy, who was the Supreme Court's swing vote, often casting the deciding opinion in 5-4 cases, consolidating a conservative majority at the top court. Some Democrats fiercely opposed to his name for his views on delicate issues such as abortion. His views on the environment and gun rights have also raised concerns among environmentalists and gun control activists. On the court since: 27 October 2020 How she got to the court: Born in New Orleans of Irish and French ancestry, Barrett was the eldest of seven children in a devoutly Catholic family and is now herself a mother of seven. She was the student body vice-president at her all-girls Catholic high school. After graduating first in her class at Notre Dame Law School, in Indiana, she clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, and later worked on George W Bush's election lawsuit in 2000. Barrett also became a distinguished law professor at her alma mater. She was picked for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 by President Donald Trump and was nominated to the high court less than three years later. Who is she as a justice? Often considered a protege of Justice Scalia, Barrett is a proponent of textualism, the view that judges should apply the law as written and interpret the US Constitution as it was originally intended. In her acceptance speech at the White House, Barrett said: \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\" She has said her Catholic faith does not influence her rulings. Past legal opinions and remarks on abortion and gay marriage have made her popular with the religious right, but have earned her vehement opposition from the left. She drew scrutiny for her reported leadership role, with the title of \"handmaid\", in the People of Praise, a tight-knit, Christian faith-based group.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The demonizing of the LBGTQ community is also an attempt to push history backwards, she added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere have been gay people whether or not the word was ever spoken,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Disney said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt denies the fact that everyone, conservative or not, has a gay friend or a transgender family member.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Florida Governor Ron Desantis and state Republican lawmakers recently passed the so called \u201a\u00c4\u00faDon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 bill, which bars elementary school educators from discussing gender identity and sexual orientation issues with students and is at the root of the conservative backlash against Disney. Desantis signaled support for stripping the compnay of its 55-year-old special status that allows it to operate as a quasi independent government inside its Orlando theme park. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis attack against Disney was so timed and rolled out so strategically that it was really hard for me to imagine that it didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t come from a series of decisions that got made in the background,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Disney said.

It even has control of time itself - or, at least, over the time that is displayed on the nation's clocks. Since World War One, the US - like many nations around the world - has set its clocks forward during summer hours in order to have more daylight in the afternoon (and, theoretically, conserve electricity), then rolled them back in autumn. On Tuesday, the US Senate voted to do away with that switch, making Daylight Savings Time - the summer month clock settings - permanent year-round. The legislation, called the Sunshine Protection Act, is the pet project of Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida (whose nickname, perhaps not coincidentally, is \"the Sunshine State\"). He has been pitching legislation to make Daylight Savings Time permanent for four years, but this is the first time he's found some success. The Senate measure was approved by unanimous consent - a process usually reserved for non-controversial legislation like naming post offices, designating disease-awareness days and celebrating sports league champions - just a few days after the US implemented its annual \"spring forward\" time change. \"Pardon the pun,\" Mr Rubio said after the bill was approved, \"but this is an idea whose time has come.\" During his floor speech, the Florida senator presented a number of arguments in favour of the change. He said there are studies showing that clock-switching has a deleterious effect on health. Heart attacks and accident rates increase around the time changes. And anything that gives children more daylight to play in after school ends, instead of sitting inside, in front of electronics, is a good thing in his mind. (Florida is a state where children might still want to play outside in January, of course.) Education is a concern for opponents of the legislation, however, who note that more children will end up going to school in the dark - which could be dangerous - under the new system. Any one senator could have objected and prevented passage of Mr Rubio's proposal, but the speed at which it came up for consideration may have caught opponents off-guard. According to Buzzfeed News, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton would have blocked the bill but his staff didn't inform him the legislation was being brought to the floor. Confusion seemed to be the order of the day for all but a handful of the Senate's daylight time enthusiasts. \"It's literally an issue my staff and I had never discussed, and they made an assumption that I don't really care about daylight saving time,\" Delaware Senator Chris Coons told Buzzfeed. \"And I don't know if I do! I've never taken five minutes to stop and think about it.\" It's too late for that now, at least in the Senate. The legislation moves to the House of Representatives, where it must also be approved by majority vote before it can be signed into law by President Joe Biden. The White House hasn't taken a position on the matter, but House Speaker Nany Pelosi, after expressing  her own surprise that the Senate had acted so quickly, said she supported the measure - although she added that her chamber was more focused on tasks related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Maryland women suffered two broken bones after four suspects, who were caught on camera assaulting her, attempted to steal her car in Prince George's County. The incident took place on March 29, when the four suspects approached the victim during her return home from running errands, according to Fox 5 Washington DC.

One, from last week, shows a Russian helicopter flying low, just above the tree line - in the hope of avoiding what's about to happen next. Tracking its path is the smoking trail of a surface-to-air missile. In a matter of seconds the missile has found its target. On impact the Russian helicopter crashes to the ground, before bursting into a fireball Russian aircraft are being shot down by Ukrainian forces - as well as the video above, this video shows a jet hit near Kharkiv - and military analysts believe there's evidence that recently supplied weapons by the West are already being used. Justin Bronk, a research fellow on airpower at the Royal United Services Institute, says there's been visual confirmation of at least 20 Russian aircraft shot down in Ukraine so far - both helicopters and jets. That's significantly fewer than claimed by Ukraine's ministry of defence, which says it has downed 48 Russian planes and 80 helicopters. Yet even the lower number shows Russia's struggled to gain supremacy in the skies. Ukraine has suffered losses too. But UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that Russia had so far not been successful in destroying the country's air defences and air force. Before the war began, Ukraine's military aircraft were outnumbered at least three-to-one by those that had been amassed on the border by Russia. Mr Wallace said Ukraine's ability to keep some of its air defences intact was already forcing Russian aircraft to fly at night to avoid detection. Shoulder-launched air defence missiles, also known as Manpads (man-portable air defence systems) are just one of the weapons that Western nations have been supplying to Ukraine. They include the infamous US-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles - scourge of Soviet aircraft during its occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Exact numbers are hard to come by. Last week Mr Wallace told the BBC the West had now delivered \"thousands\" of anti-tank weapons and \"over a thousand\" Stingers. CNN, quoting a US defence official, put the total at 17,000 anti-tank weapons and 2,000 Stingers, sent by the US and Nato allies. Britain and America had provided weapons to Ukraine before the invasion began on 24 February, with the UK delivering 2,000 light anti-tank missiles (Nlaws). Commenting on reports that they were already being used to destroy Russian armoured columns, Mr Wallace said \"we've got anecdotal evidence to verify that\". Most countries, though, only started to send weapons in response to the Russian invasion. In all, 14 nations have supplied arms. They include Sweden and Finland, both of which have a long history of neutrality and are not members of Nato. But both have sent thousands of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Germany has supplied 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles. The Baltic states have also delivered thousands of weapons including Stingers and Javelin missiles, one of the world's most effective anti-tank weapons with a range of 2.5km (1.5 miles). Ukraine says it has already successfully destroyed several Russian T-72 tanks. Recent weapons deliveries also include tens of thousands of assault rifles and machine guns, anti-tank mines and hundreds of tonnes of ammunition, as well as body armour and helmets, and medical supplies. How are the weapons getting through? The UK says it is helping \"facilitate\" the deliveries of these weapons. Western officials, though, are not giving details of how the supplies are getting through. But it's no secret that while Russia's military operations have been focused in eastern Ukraine, the flow of people and supplies from the west of the country has continued via neighbouring European states. The BBC has spoken to the defence ministries of Estonia, Sweden and Denmark, all of whom confirmed their weapons supplies had been tracked and successfully reached Ukraine in recent weeks. So, how much difference are these weapons consignments making? Weapons supplied by the West can make a difference, but only if Ukraine continues to have armed forces capable of using them. Mr Bronk says Ukraine's ability to retain some of its older, Soviet-era, air defence systems - which have a longer range - has forced Russian aircraft to fly lower. But that makes them more vulnerable to the shorter-range surface-to-air missiles being supplied by the West. Without those longer-range air defence systems, Russian aircraft could fly higher to avoid the dangers of shorter-range air defences. Meanwhile, America and European allies are looking to increase their arms supplies to Ukraine. There may be a limited opportunity before Russia tries to target any supply lines of weapons. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said he's had talks with Poland about it supplying Russian-made Mig fighter jets to the Ukrainian Air Force. But even if that happened, Ukraine would still need trained pilots to fly them. The supply of Western weapons helps, but you still need an army that knows how to use them.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

US President Joe Biden said the move targeted \"the main artery of Russia's economy\". Energy exports are a vital source of revenue for Russia but the move is also likely to impact Western consumers. Major brands have meanwhile continued to pull out of Russia, with McDonald's and Coca-Cola the latest to leave. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on energy. It is the world's third-biggest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia and the US. Before the measures were announced, Russia warned of \"catastrophic\" consequences for the global economy and said it might close its main gas pipeline to Germany. On the ground in Ukraine, civilians have been evacuated from two under-attack areas while the US has said up to 4,000 Russian troops may have been killed in the conflict. The conflict has already sent petrol prices to record highs in the US and the UK and experts warn they could go even higher. However, Venezuela could increase its oil production to help replace Russian oil. Reinaldo Quintero, president of the association that represents Venezuelan oil companies told the BBC that the country could potentially raise its production levels by 400,000 barrels a day. \"I think we can reach 1.2 million barrels per day with the infrastructure we have right now at this moment. So that will make us able to supply the need, some of the need, to the North American market,\" he said. President Biden's announcement followed pressure from both sides of the US political divide to do more to target the Russian economy. \"We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,\" he said. \"That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to [President Vladimir] Putin.\" Mr Biden admitted the move was \"not without cost at home,\" adding the decision was taken \"in close consultation\" with allies. In a similar move, the UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, accepted that the move would not hit Russia immediately but added \"what it will do is add to the pressure we're already seeing on Russia and don't forget that the economic impact of the sanctions that the UK has led has been extreme\". About 8% of US oil and refined product imports come from Russia, while Russia makes up about 6% of the UK's oil imports. By contrast, the EU is much more reliant on Russian energy, so the bloc's response stopped short of a ban. The European Commission said it would switch to alternative supplies and expand clean energy faster to fill the shortfall, with the aim of making Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels \"well before 2030\". This video can not be played Watch: Five times Russians have stood up for Ukraine \"We're not standing here to say this is going to be in any way easy,\" said the European Commission's Vice-President Frans Timmermans. \"But I am also deeply convinced that even if it's not easy, even if it's very hard, it's something we need to do, because now it's also intimately linked to our security.\" Russia later announced plans to ban the exports of certain commodities and raw materials. The details are still to be worked out, but Russia is a major exporter of grain and metals. Even countries with low Russian energy imports are set to feel the impact as the measures are likely to boost already high wholesale prices. Inflation is soaring in the US, EU and the UK, adding to the pressure on households. The move adds to a long list of economic sanctions imposed against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine - the central bank has had its assets frozen, some Russian banks have been cut off from global payment networks and Germany suspended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have transported more gas from Russia to Germany. But energy sales have continued to provide a source of cash despite the other financial restrictions.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky.

Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians \u201a\u00c4\u00fahostage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration.

Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe main issue today remains humanitarian aid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video. Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are \u201a\u00c4\u00faforced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, adding that Moscow is preventing \u201a\u00c4\u00fahumanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces \u201a\u00c4\u00faviolated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance in northern Ukraine. That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing \u201a\u00c4\u00faseveral civilians\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fasidelines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe will fight to the end,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s famous wartime speech. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrengthen the sanctions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a terrorist state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits.

On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe other half largely from inside Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA little bit more than 70\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles have been fired from Belarus, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faonly a half dozen or so\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

The US Commerce Department has said the planes are in contravention of US sanctions on Russia. Providing service to these aircraft anywhere in the world - including inside Russia - may lead to heavy fines and potential jail time, it says. The list includes aircraft operated by Russian airlines, including Aeroflot. While most are Boeing aircraft, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovich - the current owner of Chelsea football club - is also included. The Russian was among seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government earlier this month in response to the Ukraine war. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. In a statement, the department said any refuelling, maintenance or repair work of any of the listed aircraft - as well as the provision of spare parts - violates US export controls. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was in response to \"Russia's brutal war of choice against Ukraine\". She added: \"We are publishing this list to put the world on notice - we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.\" The department said violators face \"substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions\". The regulations apply to any aircraft which has more than 25% US-origin content that was re-exported to Russia after new controls came into effect on 24 February, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. \"By preventing these aircraft from receiving any service, for example, including from abroad, international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded,\" the statement added. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said the US government hoped the move highlighted Russia's increasing isolation from the global economy. \"Our actions aren't idle words or dead letters on the page,\" he said. \"They have real teeth and as Putin's vicious war continues, they will continue to bite harder on the Russian and Belarusian economies\". The US, Canada and European allies have already banned Russian aircraft from operating in their airspace, forcing Russian airlines to largely abandon their international routes.

Paul Parizek called the incident \u201a\u00c4\u00faa punch in the gut,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 KCCI reported. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe kids in that school are our community\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most precious cargo,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. East High School was closed Tuesday, the statement from Des Moines Public Schools said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe DMPS grief team will be available at East High for students and staff beginning tomorrow through the remainder of the week. School counselors will be available at our other schools for students who need additional support,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the district said in a news release. 1 teen is dead and 2 are in critical condition after shooting \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think we can all agree an event like this is everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s worst nightmare. Tonight, hug your students and love them,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Principal Jill Versteeg said in the statement. Shootings in and near schools have become too common, Superintendent Thomas Ahart said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur staff and students are forced to train for these incidents and the trauma associated with the repeated drills and incidents will remain with them for years to come. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unfortunate that our state and our country have become a place where firearms are far too easily accessible. We remain committed to protecting our students and staff, but real change to gun laws and access would go a long way to help us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ahart said in the statement. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) of Kansas City went to the scene to assist in the investigation, the agency tweeted. Other agencies assisting with the investigation include the Iowa State Patrol, Polk County Sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office, the FBI and the Des Moines Public Schools Department of Public Safety.

US President Joe Biden said the move targeted \"the main artery of Russia's economy\". Energy exports are a vital source of revenue for Russia but the move is also likely to impact Western consumers. Major brands have meanwhile continued to pull out of Russia, with McDonald's and Coca-Cola the latest to leave. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on energy. It is the world's third-biggest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia and the US. Before the measures were announced, Russia warned of \"catastrophic\" consequences for the global economy and said it might close its main gas pipeline to Germany. On the ground in Ukraine, civilians have been evacuated from two under-attack areas while the US has said up to 4,000 Russian troops may have been killed in the conflict. The conflict has already sent petrol prices to record highs in the US and the UK and experts warn they could go even higher. However, Venezuela could increase its oil production to help replace Russian oil. Reinaldo Quintero, president of the association that represents Venezuelan oil companies told the BBC that the country could potentially raise its production levels by 400,000 barrels a day. \"I think we can reach 1.2 million barrels per day with the infrastructure we have right now at this moment. So that will make us able to supply the need, some of the need, to the North American market,\" he said. President Biden's announcement followed pressure from both sides of the US political divide to do more to target the Russian economy. \"We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,\" he said. \"That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to [President Vladimir] Putin.\" Mr Biden admitted the move was \"not without cost at home,\" adding the decision was taken \"in close consultation\" with allies. In a similar move, the UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, accepted that the move would not hit Russia immediately but added \"what it will do is add to the pressure we're already seeing on Russia and don't forget that the economic impact of the sanctions that the UK has led has been extreme\". About 8% of US oil and refined product imports come from Russia, while Russia makes up about 6% of the UK's oil imports. By contrast, the EU is much more reliant on Russian energy, so the bloc's response stopped short of a ban. The European Commission said it would switch to alternative supplies and expand clean energy faster to fill the shortfall, with the aim of making Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels \"well before 2030\". This video can not be played Watch: Five times Russians have stood up for Ukraine \"We're not standing here to say this is going to be in any way easy,\" said the European Commission's Vice-President Frans Timmermans. \"But I am also deeply convinced that even if it's not easy, even if it's very hard, it's something we need to do, because now it's also intimately linked to our security.\" Russia later announced plans to ban the exports of certain commodities and raw materials. The details are still to be worked out, but Russia is a major exporter of grain and metals. Even countries with low Russian energy imports are set to feel the impact as the measures are likely to boost already high wholesale prices. Inflation is soaring in the US, EU and the UK, adding to the pressure on households. The move adds to a long list of economic sanctions imposed against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine - the central bank has had its assets frozen, some Russian banks have been cut off from global payment networks and Germany suspended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have transported more gas from Russia to Germany. But energy sales have continued to provide a source of cash despite the other financial restrictions. Russia says it may cut gas supplies if oil blocked How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Sharif, the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-N party and younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, received 174 out of 342 votes in Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote in parliament and is set to serve as prime minister until the next general election, which is expected to take place in 2023. All of Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lawmakers from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party resigned en masse in protest ahead of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote, and there will now have to be urgent elections to replace them. Following the vote, Khan called on his supporters to take to the streets. His next rally is scheduled for April 16 in Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan. In a speech to parliament ahead of his swearing in, Sharif spoke of unity across the country, including his coalition government. He said he would introduce a 10% increase in pensions and raise the monthly minimum wage rate to Rs 25,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec equivalent to US $136 per month. India\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Sharif in a Twitter post that added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIndia desires peace and stability in a region free of terror, so that we can focus on our development challenges and ensure the well-being and prosperity of our people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s appointment as the 31st prime minister of Pakistan comes after widespread protests in support of Khan erupted across Pakistan late Sunday. Tens of thousands took to the streets in key cities, including Lahore and Peshawar, to support the ousted leader. They chanted slogans against the United States \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which Khan had claimed was involved in a conspiracy against him \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s powerful military, which had seemed to withdraw its support from him. Against this backdrop of political turmoil and a crumbling economy, Sharif now faces a challenging period as the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader. Unlike Khan, Sharif has maintained an amicable relationship with the military and was a popular chief minister of Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s politically important and most populous province of Punjab. He was lauded for his ambitious administrative and infrastructure projects in the province, which saw advances in the education and industrial sectors. Sharif was instrumental in driving the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a part of China\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Belt and Road Initiative, and maintains a positive relationship with Beijing. A member of the wealthy Sharif dynasty, which amassed millions by producing steel, his family was mired in scandal after his brother Nawaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison and handed a $10.5 million fine over corruption charges in 2018. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan ousted as country's leader following vote of no-confidence Shehbaz Sharif rejected the verdict, calling it \u201a\u00c4\u00faflawed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapolitically motivated.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shehbaz Sharif is also facing charges for alleged corruption. In recent months, Sharif had led a campaign to remove Khan as Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader over claims of economic mismanagement and poor governance. Along with the opposition, he had urged Khan to resign ahead of a no-confidence vote that was widely expected to dismiss Khan. Tensions smoldered for days, with Khan repeatedly rejecting the criticism and instead claiming the moves against him were an attempt at regime change backed by Washington and some members of the opposition. The allegations were denied by both the US State Department and the Pakistani opposition. In a dramatic series of events, the deputy speaker in parliament blocked the no-confidence vote against Khan. Khan then dissolved parliament and called for early elections. The opposition challenged Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s moves in Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court, with Sharif calling them \u201a\u00c4\u00fanothing short of high treason.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The court ruled last week that the blocking of the no-confidence vote against Khan was unconstitutional, paving the way for Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rise to power.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s virtual court appearance, Borges said his client has no intention to flee while she awaits trial.

She was found three weeks later, alone on Interstate 5 about 140 miles from home. She told police she had been kidnapped by two women who wore masks and spoke Spanish. They held her at gunpoint, she said, kept her chained in a closet and branded her. But last week, the Justice Department said Papini was actually with an ex-boyfriend in Southern California and that she caused her own injuries in support of her abduction claim. In all, the cost of the investigation borne by public safety agencies was around $150,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a conservative estimate, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said in a statement on Facebook last week. But the cost isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t only measured in dollars, Johnson said. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case and her story diverted resources from real cases with real victims. Years ago, she told police she had been abducted, beaten and branded. Now she's charged with making it all up \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the sheriff said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faFinally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faall of law enforcement in Shasta (County) was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling (of) this case.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case cost the public in other ways, too. According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, between 2017 and 2021, Papini received $30,000 from the California Victim Compensation Board, which assists and reimburses victims of violent crimes for \u201a\u00c4\u00facrime-related expenses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 they suffer. In Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case, the affidavit says, $1,000 was used so Papini could buy blinds for her home and nearly $2,000 were paid to the ambulance provider who transported Papini after she was found. The rest of the money were payments for Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s therapy and treatment for anxiety and post-traumatic stress stemming from her supposed kidnapping. Then, there was the GoFundMe campaign that allegedly netted just over $49,000. Per the affidavit, donors were told the funds would be used to \u201a\u00c4\u00fafind and bring Sherri home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In fact, federal prosecutors say, more than $30,000 was withdrawn by a family member from the campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bank account and more than $11,000 was used to pay off the family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s personal credit cards. The remaining amount was \u201a\u00c4\u00faspent on personal expenses,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the affidavit says.

The Oxford indie group's song spent 59 weeks on its slow ascent to the summit of the Billboard Hot 100. The previous record was held by Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, on 35 weeks. \"I absolutely can't believe it,\" singer Dave Bayley said. \"For it to do this means the absolute world.\" He added in a Twitter message to fans: \"This song came out at the beginning of the pandemic and we didn't think it would really go anywhere because of that, and it has because you guys have embraced it so much.\" There are slow-burning hits, then there's Heat Waves - a song that took longer to reach room temperature than an ice age mammoth. The song's 59-week trek to the top of the US Billboard chart eclipses the previous record-holder, Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, by a massive 24 weeks. With just one song, Glass Animals have spent 27 more weeks on the chart than The Prodigy have managed in their entire career. The Oxford band also became the first UK group to break into Spotify's global top 10 since Clean Bandit in 2018 (Coldplay have since made the chart, too). The song had all the right ingredients for a sleeper hit. Glass Animals were well respected in the industry, with a Mercury Prize nomination for their second album How To Be A Human Being - but they weren't big enough to have their song automatically added to radio station and streaming service playlists. It took months for Heat Waves to cross over from alternative radio to pop stations, building up a bigger head of steam as it went. Streaming also played a crucial part in its success. Songs tend to have a longer half-life now than 10 years ago, as fans continue to play their favourite tracks, keeping them afloat for months on end. Glass Animals were also given a late boost by TikTok, where creator Juliette Cullen used Heat Waves to soundtrack a viral video about a lack of curly fries in certain branches of McDonald's. The band have joked its success is all down to Bayley's mum streaming it on a loop\u2026 but given that the song's been played 1.3 billion times on Spotify alone, she'd had to have started 9,900 years ago. In reality, it's just a great song - one whose vibey production and low-key hooks reveal new treasures on each listen. Hopefully its success will encourage people to seek out the rest of the band's equally-rewarding back catalogue. The song, which was originally released as a single in June 2020, first snuck into the US singles chart in 100th place in January 2021. Allow YouTube content?

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24.

The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday.

Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

Prescribing a rigid approach to what must be \u201a\u00c4\u00f2taught\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 in those discussions will lessen if not erase them.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 SB1 states in part that public schools shall provide instructions that align with certain concepts including: \u201a\u00c4\u00faAn individual, by virtue of the individual\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed by other members of the same race or sex;\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe understanding that the institution of slavery and post-Civil War laws enforcing racial segregation and discrimination were contrary to the fundamental American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, but that defining racial disparities solely on the legacy of this institution is destructive to the unification of our nation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In his letter, Beshear said that children and adults must be able to exercise their First Amendment rights and have important discussions free of government censorship. The bill received final passage from the state Senate last month, according to the Kentucky General Assembly page on SB 1. Kentucky's Democratic governor vetoes anti-trans sports ban Although the legislation does not implicitly use the term critical race theory, the bill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s language shares similarities with other measures passed in Republican-controlled states. Samuel Crankshaw, communications manager for the ACLU of Kentucky, said Wednesday that SB 1 is \u201a\u00c4\u00fapart of a nationwide strategy to whitewash history, perpetuate white supremacy, and erase marginalized people \u201a\u00c4\u00ec particularly people of color and LGBTQ people. They would also deny educators and students their First Amendment right to free speech.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beshear notes that the bill would require teachers to incorporate \u201a\u00c4\u00faa specific set of historical documents and speeches\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 into lectures. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThese texts were not selected by historians or scholars, but by a political body.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 One of the required texts is Ronald Reagan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 1964 political campaign speech \u201a\u00c4\u00faA Time For Choosing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beshear said. \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe fact that this text is included over others like Dwight Eisenhower\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement to troops in advance of the D-Day invasion suggests the bill is aimed more at politics than at history.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The House passed the current version of the bill with a vote of 67-29 and the Senate passed the bill 21-15-1.

A San Francisco jury on Monday found a police officer facing four counts of assault and battery charges not guilty after four days of deliberation. District Attorney (DA) Chesa Boudin, who first announced charges against San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Officer Terrance Stangel in December 2020, was accused of withholding evidence in the case earlier this year. Stangel was accused of unnecessarily beating a Black man named Dacari Spiers with a baton in October 2019, breaking Spiers' wrist and leg, while responding to a domestic violence call. \"We are thankful that the jury was able to see through the dishonesty of the DA\u2019s office in this case and see it for what it was \u2013 unjust and unsupported,\" Stangel's attorney, Nicole Pifari, said in a statement Monday evening following the verdict in a San Francisco Superior Court. \"Everyone should be deeply concerned about this case, about this District Attorney, and about the rule of law in San Francisco.\" Police officer Terrance Stangel, second from the left, enters Department 27 at the Hall of Justice with his attorney Nicole Pifari on Monday, March 7, 2022, in San Francisco, California.

It is unclear if prosecutors will refile the charge. SAN FRANCISCO DA CHESA BOUDIN ACCUSED OF WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE IN OFFICER MISCONDUCT CASE Boudin thanked the jury \"for their careful consideration of this case over the course of four full days of deliberation\" in a Monday statement. \"We respect the jury process, although we remain disappointed that police accountability remains so elusive and difficult to achieve,\" he said. \"I am committed to continuing to hold those who commit harm accountable \u2013 regardless of the uniform they may wear or the badge they may carry.

Hayashi told Caffese\u00a0that she never disclosed information from a female witness who claimed to see Spiers beating a woman before Stangel hit him with a baton and that she feared she would be fired if she did, according to the outlet. SAN FRANCISCO DA BOUDIN'S OFFICE \u2018THREATENED\u2019 INVESTIGATOR MULTIPLE TIMES TO WITHHOLD EVIDENCE: TRANSCRIPT Pifari filed a motion to dismiss the case on Jan. 24, citing \"prosecutorial misconduct\" and \"deceptive\" methods by the DA's office. The memo in support of the motion to dismiss filed by Pifari includes a transcript from the witness to 911, which is what initially led police to respond to the 2019 incident.

Spiers and his girlfriend begged the officers to stop, and he was left with \"horrendous blows with his hands and wrists, which caused severe injuries, including a severely broken wrist,\" the complaint states. Spiers accused the city of violating his civil rights. On March 2, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted Spiers' motion to sanction the city and county of San Francisco for withholding evidence from Spiers. Video footage of the incident released last year shows a chaotic scene in which Spiers questions officers' use of force, saying he didn't do anything. Stangel was acquitted of felony charges, including battery with serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon and assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury. He faced up to seven years in prison, according to the Chronicle. Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

Jackson said that she was a beneficiary of the Civil Rights Act passed in the decade before she was born, hardworking parents who gave her an African name \u201a\u00c4\u00ec \u201a\u00c4\u00faKetanji Onyika\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00falovely one\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and those who came before her, including Judge Constance Baker Motley, the first African American woman to be appointed to the federal bench. But Jackson, like some previous Supreme Court nominees, gave little hint of her personal judicial philosophy, saying she decides cases \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom a neutral posture\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and interprets the law \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout fear or favor, consistent with my judicial oath.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and the grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Jackson. Democrats touted President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pick as a qualified, boundary-breaking nominee, while some Republicans criticized her record on crime and the support she holds from left-wing groups. Jackson, 51, sits on DC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement. Jackson worked as a clerk for Breyer, a federal public defender, an attorney in private practice, a federal district court judge and a member of the US Sentencing Commission. At the hearing Monday, Jackson and the senators delivered their opening statements establishing the arguments for and against her confirmation. She was introduced by Judge Thomas Griffith, formerly of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Lisa Fairfax, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, her daughters Leila and Talia, and her husband Patrick were sitting behind her. Jackson will answer questions from the members on Tuesday and Wednesday, and witnesses will testify on Thursday. Democrats hope to confirm Jackson by early April. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, opened the hearing by putting Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination in historical context, noting that of 115 Supreme Court justices, 108 have been white men. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot a single justice has been a Black woman,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Durbin said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou, Judge Jackson, can be the first.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not easy being the first,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut your presence here today, your willingness to brave this process, will give inspiration to millions of Americans who see themselves in you.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 No Democratic senators have signaled they will oppose Jackson, and some Republicans have expressed openness to supporting her. In the 50-50 Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris could break a tied vote and confirm Jackson to the Supreme Court. READ: Ketanji Brown Jackson's opening statement at her Supreme Court confirmation hearing But many Republican senators are expected to oppose the nomination and some preemptively defended themselves from any criticisms that voting against Jackson would be perceived as sexist or racist, noting that Democrats have opposed diverse picks in the past because of their judicial philosophy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be looking to see whether Judge Jackson is committed to the Constitution as originally understood,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Republicans previewed on Monday their attempts to portray Jackson as weak on crime. Grassley said in his opening statement that there are two types of nominees who have worked criminal cases: \u201a\u00c4\u00faBill of Rights attorneys who want to protect defendants\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 constitutional rights\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facriminal defense lawyers who disagree with our criminal laws.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faOf course, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a very important difference,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Grassley said. Some Republican senators indicated that they will press Jackson for advocating on behalf of detainees at Guant\u221a\u00b0namo Bay in private practice after representing them as a public defender. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m a bit troubled by some of the positions you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve taken and arguments that you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made representing people who have committed terrorist acts against the United States and other dangerous criminals,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has raised concerns about Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s record on sentencing in child pornography cases. Hawley said on Twitter last week that there is \u201a\u00c4\u00faan alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s treatment of sex offenders, especially those preying on children.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Democrats have refuted Republicans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attacks since her nomination. When Biden gave a speech announcing his pick in February, he made sure to note that Jackson came from \u201a\u00c4\u00faa family of law enforcement, with her brother and uncles having served as police officers.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 GOP senators push misleading portrayal of Ketanji Brown Jackson's record on child porn cases The White House and Senate Democrats have pushed back on Hawley\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attack, noting that Jackson has the support of law enforcement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police, and dozens of former state attorneys general. They noted she has already been confirmed by the Senate three times. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn the vast majority of cases involving child sex crimes, the sentences Judge Jackson imposed were consistent with or above what the government or US probation recommended,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. A CNN review of the material in question shows that Jackson has mostly followed the common judicial sentencing practices in these kinds of cases and that Hawley took some of her comments out of context by suggesting they were opinions, rather than follow-up questions to subject-matter experts. It has become a norm among judges to issue sentences below the guidelines in certain child pornography cases that don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t involve producing the pornography itself. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSome have said that the federal sentencing guidelines are too harsh on child sex crimes, especially child pornography,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Hawley on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll just be honest. I can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say that I agree with that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 There are other matters Republicans may probe. During Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s confirmation hearings last year, some Senate Republicans focused on a 2019 case she heard between the House Judiciary Committee, which was looking into then-President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s possible obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Russia investigation, and former White House counsel Don McGahn. Ongoing cases involving Trump and the powers of government could land before her on the Supreme Court, including disputes over whether Congress can access Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial records and whether Trump could be held accountable by private litigants for the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Last year, Grassley challenged Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s declaration that \u201a\u00c4\u00fapresidents are not kings\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and suggested she was engaged in a kind of hyperbole. Senate Republicans have also pushed for Jackson to publicly oppose efforts to expand the court, which activists on the left have called for since they blocked then-President Barack Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 and then expanded, under Trump, the high court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conservative majority from 5-4 to 6-3. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination to replace another liberal will not change the ideological balance of the court. Confirmation hearings to spotlight rightward trajectory of America's highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00faNine is a number that works,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe must protect the court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Still, even those who may oppose Jackson expect the hearings this week to be less contentious than those in the Trump era, which altered the balance of the court and, in the case of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, centered on allegations of sexual assault. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMost of us couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go back to our offices during Kavanaugh without getting spit on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Graham to his Democratic colleagues. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI hope that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t happen to y\u201a\u00c4\u00f4all. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think it will.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jackson may receive some votes from Republicans. Last year, she received three \u201a\u00c4\u00ec from Graham, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u201a\u00c4\u00ec confirming her to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Graham preferred for Biden to choose Judge J. Michelle Childs from his home state and criticized the President for picking another Ivy League-educated nominee, claiming on Monday that Childs would\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve received \u201a\u00c4\u00fa60-plus\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 votes, including from himself. Jackson went to a public high school in Miami before earning both her undergraduate degree and law degree at Harvard University. Graham, like other Republicans, criticized Jackson for holding the support of left-wing groups. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re facing a choice sponsored by the most radical elements of the Democratic party when it comes to how to be a judge,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Graham said. Murkowski has said that her previous support of Jackson to be a judge does not signal how she would vote for Jackson to be a justice. But Collins has praised Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s credentials and experience as \u201a\u00c4\u00faimpressive.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Maine Republican said she would not make her decision until after the Judiciary Committee hearings.

Over the past week, firefighters have been trying to protect people and homes as 178 wildfires burned more than 108,000 acres across the state, the Texas A&M Forest Service said Monday. Ongoing and hard-to-control wildfires affecting southwest Texas were expected to get worse Monday, according to a forest service statement. Authorities said increased wildfire activity was due to \u201a\u00c4\u00facritical fire weather and high winds\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 detected Sunday along Interstate 35. Firefighters this past week have responded to 178 wildfires that burned 108,493 acres across the state, the statement said. As of Sunday, there were 23 active wildfires, Texas A&M Forest Service spokesperson Erin O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Connor said. The largest was the Eastland Complex Fire ripping through central Texas.

Statewide, the severe weather could impact up to 20 million Texans throughout the afternoon and evening hours, Shackelford added. Abbott directed the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s emergency management office to mobilize several units and put them on standby for rapid deployment, including two search and rescue teams and multiple swiftwater boat teams. At least one person has died as a result of the flames. Eastland County Deputy Sgt.

Kentucky's Democratic governor vetoes anti-trans sports ban Although the legislation does not implicitly use the term critical race theory, the bill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s language shares similarities with other measures passed in Republican-controlled states.

SAN FRANCISCO DA CHESA BOUDIN ACCUSED OF WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE IN OFFICER MISCONDUCT CASE Boudin thanked the jury \"for their careful consideration of this case over the course of four full days of deliberation\" in a Monday statement. \"We respect the jury process, although we remain disappointed that police accountability remains so elusive and difficult to achieve,\" he said. \"I am committed to continuing to hold those who commit harm accountable \u2013 regardless of the uniform they may wear or the badge they may carry. No one should be above the law, and my office will continue to fight to ensure that all communities are safe.\" San Francisco Police Officers Association Acting President Tracy McCray, right, and Kevin Martin. (Lea Suzuki/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) The verdict comes more than a month after an investigator for the DA's office, Megan Hayashi, testified on Jan. 28 that she felt she would be fired if she did not withhold certain evidence in the case against Stangel, NBC Bay Area reported at the time. Hayashi told Caffese\u00a0that she never disclosed information from a female witness who claimed to see Spiers beating a woman before Stangel hit him with a baton and that she feared she would be fired if she did, according to the outlet. SAN FRANCISCO DA BOUDIN'S OFFICE \u2018THREATENED\u2019 INVESTIGATOR MULTIPLE TIMES TO WITHHOLD EVIDENCE: TRANSCRIPT Pifari filed a motion to dismiss the case on Jan. 24, citing \"prosecutorial misconduct\" and \"deceptive\" methods by the DA's office. The memo in support of the motion to dismiss filed by Pifari includes a transcript from the witness to 911, which is what initially led police to respond to the 2019 incident. Police officer Terrance Stangel, center, and lawyer Nicole Pifari enter the courtroom at the Hall of Justice on Feb. 8, 2022, in San Francisco, California. (Gabrielle Lurie/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) The call transcript reads as follows: \"I would like to report \u2026 I think it's called domestic violence or something because, um, there's this guy who is beating up on this girl. \u2026 He's like, um, holding her like by the neck, like draggin' her by the neck. \u2026 She was trying to get away, then he grabbed, and then he got her again.\" A second witness described similar details in a statement, including in Pifari's motion. Boudin prematurely labeled one of the witnesses as a \"racially-biased Karen,\" according to FOX 2 San Francisco. \"The citizens of San Francisco should be asking themselves why Chesa Boudin would come out of the starting gate [labeling] the two African American women who called 911 as \u2018Karen Callers,\u2019\" Pifari said in her statement. \"\u2026 If Chesa Boudin is willing to break and bend the law as many times as his office did in this case, everyone should be afraid.\" Spiers filed a federal lawsuit against the city of San Francisco in February 2020, which states that he was \"consoling his girlfriend about the theft\" of her wallet before the attack, \"and the two were leaning against the car and were engaged in hugging and kissing each other.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The lawsuit then alleges that two or more officers approached Spiers at that moment and abruptly grabbed him. Spiers and his girlfriend begged the officers to stop, and he was left with \"horrendous blows with his hands and wrists, which caused severe injuries, including a severely broken wrist,\" the complaint states. Spiers accused the city of violating his civil rights. On March 2, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted Spiers' motion to sanction the city and county of San Francisco for withholding evidence from Spiers. Video footage of the incident released last year shows a chaotic scene in which Spiers questions officers' use of force, saying he didn't do anything. Stangel was acquitted of felony charges, including battery with serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon and assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury. He faced up to seven years in prison, according to the Chronicle. Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

State Judge Arthur Engoron in February had ordered Trump to \u201a\u00c4\u00facomply in full\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s subpoena seeking documents and information. Engoron also ruled that Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump should comply with the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s subpoenas for testimony, but the Trumps are appealing that decision. Justice Department investigating handling of White House records taken to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left office Friday afternoon, Engoron said Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorneys must appear in court on April 25 to defend against the contempt request. In a motion filed Thursday, the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office said that that Trump \u201a\u00c4\u00fadid not comply at all\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the subpoena for documents and that his attorneys said he would not produce \u201a\u00c4\u00faany\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 documents in response to the subpoena because his attorneys believe that if the documents exist, the Trump Organization would have them and the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office \u201a\u00c4\u00fawill just have to wait until the Trump Organization completes its production to get them.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 According to new filings, her office had agreed to extend an early March deadline for the documents until March 31. But rather than produce the documents that day, Trump presented 16 objections to the subpoena\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s demands. Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorneys also presented the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office an affidavit from a Trump lawyer claiming that the former President was unable to locate the documents being and to the extent the documents existed, they were in the custody of Trump Organization, which faces a separate subpoena deadline. James argued on Thursday that Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorneys\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 response amounted to  \u201a\u00c4\u00famore delay and obfuscation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 saying that his objections came too late. She said that Trump was \u201a\u00c4\u00fahighly likely to have been in possession, custody or control of numerous documents\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 bearing on her investigation and that he failed to adequately detail the efforts he undertook to search for the subpoenaed documents. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMr. Trump should now be held in civil contempt and fined in an amount sufficient to coerce his compliance with the Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s order and compensate OAG for its fees and costs associated with this motion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the filing stated. James is asking the court to impose a fine of $10,000 per day, or any other amount the court deems \u201a\u00c4\u00fasufficient to coerce his compliance with the Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s February 2022 Order,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as well as compensation for the attorney general offices costs and fees in filing the motion. Investigation into Trump Org. is ongoing despite resignations of top prosecutors, NY district attorney says An attorney for Trump said in a statement Thursday that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe are prepared to adamantly oppose the frivolous and baseless motion filed by the Attorney General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office today.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur client has consistently complied with the many discovery requests served by the Attorney General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office over the years,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the attorney, Alina Habba, said. James previously said her office found multiple misleading or fraudulent misstatements and omissions in the Trump Organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial statements, which were provided to lenders and insurers, among others, as part of its investigation. In addition to the civil investigation James has launched, the Trump Organization also faces a criminal investigation being led by the Manhattan district attorney. Public turmoil has surrounded District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s probe, which he inherited from his predecessor, Cyrus Vance, after the high-profile departure of two senior prosecutors.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAfter 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians \u201a\u00c4\u00fahostage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration. Ukrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing \u201a\u00c4\u00fachildren, women and the elderly\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 out of the city, and have launched an attack \u201a\u00c4\u00faprecisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Joint Forces Operation said. CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response. A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been \u201a\u00c4\u00faisolated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it \u201a\u00c4\u00fain any significant way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days. Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe main issue today remains humanitarian aid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video. Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are \u201a\u00c4\u00faforced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, adding that Moscow is preventing \u201a\u00c4\u00fahumanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces \u201a\u00c4\u00faviolated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance in northern Ukraine. That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing \u201a\u00c4\u00faseveral civilians\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fasidelines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe will fight to the end,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s famous wartime speech. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrengthen the sanctions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a terrorist state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. Zelensky's heroism is coming up against Western red lines \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stoltenberg. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe situation could spiral out of control,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe other half largely from inside Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA little bit more than 70\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles have been fired from Belarus, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faonly a half dozen or so\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

A US jury found Roger Ng guilty on all charges in the trial, which concerned the looting of billions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund. He is the only Goldman Sachs banker to face a jury over the scandal, which rocked Malaysian politics and forced the bank to pay billions in fines. He had pleaded not guilty. Mr Ng's lawyer said he was a \"fall guy \"and attacked the credibility of the government's star witness, Tim Leissner, who was Mr Ng's boss at Goldman Sachs and pleaded guilty to his role in the scandal in 2018. But after a nearly two-month trial and several days of deliberation, the jury in New York convicted Mr Ng of conspiring to launder money and violating an anti-corruption law. US prosecutors said the decision was \"a victory for not only the rule of law, but also for the people of Malaysia\". \"The defendant and his cronies saw 1MDB not as an entity to do good for the people of Malaysia, but as a piggy bank to enrich themselves with piles of money siphoned from the fund,\" said US Attorney Breon Peace. \"With today's verdict, a powerful message has been delivered to those who commit financial crimes motivated by greed. You will be caught, prosecuted and convicted, like Ng, and face a long prison sentence.\" The charges stemmed from bond deals that Goldman helped arrange in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5bn (\u00a35bn) for the 1MDB fund, which was founded to finance public development projects. Authorities say more than $4bn was stolen and spent on art, diamonds and property - even helping to finance Hollywood's Wolf of Wall Street film. Prosecutors said Goldman Sachs bankers helped to arrange laundering of some of the money, some of which was paid as bribes to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to help win business for the bank. Prosecutors said 49-year-old Mr Ng was central to the scheme, introducing Mr Leissner to Chinese-Malaysian financier Jho Low, the alleged mastermind and a confidant of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Jho Low was indicted alongside Ng in 2018 but remains at large. They told the court that Mr Ng, who worked for Goldman from 2005 to May 2014, received $35m in kickbacks for his role. Mr Ng's team had claimed the payment was part of a legitimate business deal involving his wife. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, also gave the court accounts of Mr Leissner's deceit, calling him a \"double bigamist\" for twice being married to two women at the same time. He previously admitted forging divorce papers to marry an analyst at the bank while still married to his first wife. Mr Ng, who could be sentenced to decades in prison, may appeal, Mr Agnifilo said. In 2020, Goldman reached a $3.9bn settlement with the Malaysian government for its role in the multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme. It also paid nearly $3bn to authorities in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB. The same year, Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak was sentenced to 12 years in jail after he was found guilty of abusing his power, laundering money and breaching the public's trust. He remains free pending an appeal in Malaysian court.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Wildfires ripping through West Texas this week prompted evacuations on Thursday and Friday, according to local authorities. The Texas A&M Forest Service issued a wildfire danger warning Thursday in the Gainesville, Fort Worth, Wichita Falls, Abilene, Midland, San Angelo, Austin, San Antonio and Del Rio areas, noting that high wind speeds of up to 40 mph with low humidity are fueling fires. \"Texas A&M Forest Service has been monitoring the fire environment and increased wildfire activity this week,\" Wes Moorehead, Texas A&M Forest Service Fire Chief, said in a Wednesday statement. \"The potential for significant, large wildfires has developed. \u2026 Wildfires that ignite under these forecast conditions are highly resistant to firefighters\u2019 suppression efforts and pose a threat to public safety. We encourage residents to be cautious tomorrow, be prepared and listen to warnings from local officials.\" West Texas wildfires. (Texas A&M Forest Service) Firefighters have been working to contain thousand-acre fires across the West Texas area since Wednesday, according to the fire service. SEVERE STORMY WEATHER, TORNADOS FORECAST ACROSS US As of Friday morning, the fires had burned about 62.5 square miles, according to Texas A&M Forest Service. In Eastland County, which is nearly 40,000 acres, four separate fires that merged into one \"complex\" were only 2% contained as of Friday morning. About 18,000 people live in Eastland County, where the large fire was burning, prompting evacuations. Evacuation orders in other counties, including Taylor and Coleman Counties, were put into effect Thursday afternoon, according to FOX West Texas. A church and several buildings in Ranger burned down Thursday, Dallas TV station WFAA reported The fire fueled by high winds may have started from a barbecue pit, Ranger Fire Department Chief Darrell Fox said. \"We had everything ready throughout the county,\" Fox told The Associated Press. \"But when we have the winds like there was ... and the humidity down to nothing, this is what you\u2019re going to get.\" No injuries have been reported as of Friday morning.

Edward Kassig held back tears as he read a letter from his son, Peter Kassig, one of four Americans killed by the terror cell known as the Beatles. Alleged member El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, is accused of kidnapping and conspiracy. He has denied all charges. The elder Mr Kassig is the latest family member of victims to give evidence at the trial of Mr Elsheikh, who is the highest profile IS fighter to face justice in a US court. Describing his son's final letter, Mr Kassig said: \"This was a young man knowing his time had come. It was his farewell.\" Then he read the letter. \"I spent a long time taking life for granted and taunting death,\" his 26-year-old son wrote. \"I have never wanted to live more. I don't want you and Mum ruined over this.\" He said he \"cried a lot in the first few months, but not anymore\". Prosecutors in the case argue that Mr Elsheikh was deeply involved in ransom demands from the families of hostages, and the executions the so-called Beatles carried out. The defence, however, have said that the Sudanese-born Londoner was not part of the group and merely \"a simple Isis fighter\". Several family members of victims have testified about email exchanges with Beatle captors as part of the prosecution's case. Ed Kassig recounted receiving the first in December 2013 saying: \"Peter is at this moment our guest and we don't want to harm him\" and later, a message demanding 100 million euro in exchange for his release. The Kassigs had several subsequent email exchanges with their son's captors. In a video message to IS, they said their son \"grew to love Syria\" and had \"embraced Islam\" - a nod to his conversion while in captivity, and changing his name from Peter to Abdulrahman. They were able to receive a letter from their son in June 2014, even as they appealed to the White House and told the IS captors they were \"turning every stone\" to meet the ransom demands. However, the IS group released a video in November 2014 apparently showing Mr Kassig being executed. A FBI agent confirmed his death to the family, Mr Kassig said. His son had been a \"caring kid\" and particularly \"sensitive to the needs of others\", he told the court. He had served in the US Army and did a tour in the Middle East before becoming an aid worker after going to Turkey in 2013 and taking trips over the border to Syria, his father said. He founded the aid group Special Emergency Response and Assistance (Sera) because he \"realised there was a lethal time lag between when war breaks out and aid comes in,\" and it provided food and medical supplies to anyone in need. \"It didn't matter if it was a jihadi or a refugee,\" Mr Kassig said. Mr Elsheikh - on Wednesday wearing a white shirt and black mask - sat back in his chair and listened intently to the testimony, cocking his head slightly to look at the government's evidence, and making no eye contact with the witness. The trial continues, with as many as 50 witnesses expected.

Sharif, the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-N party and younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, received 174 out of 342 votes in Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote in parliament and is set to serve as prime minister until the next general election, which is expected to take place in 2023. All of Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lawmakers from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party resigned en masse in protest ahead of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote, and there will now have to be urgent elections to replace them. Following the vote, Khan called on his supporters to take to the streets. His next rally is scheduled for April 16 in Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan. In a speech to parliament ahead of his swearing in, Sharif spoke of unity across the country, including his coalition government. He said he would introduce a 10% increase in pensions and raise the monthly minimum wage rate to Rs 25,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec equivalent to US $136 per month. India\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Sharif in a Twitter post that added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIndia desires peace and stability in a region free of terror, so that we can focus on our development challenges and ensure the well-being and prosperity of our people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s appointment as the 31st prime minister of Pakistan comes after widespread protests in support of Khan erupted across Pakistan late Sunday. Tens of thousands took to the streets in key cities, including Lahore and Peshawar, to support the ousted leader. They chanted slogans against the United States \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which Khan had claimed was involved in a conspiracy against him \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s powerful military, which had seemed to withdraw its support from him. Against this backdrop of political turmoil and a crumbling economy, Sharif now faces a challenging period as the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader. Unlike Khan, Sharif has maintained an amicable relationship with the military and was a popular chief minister of Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s politically important and most populous province of Punjab. He was lauded for his ambitious administrative and infrastructure projects in the province, which saw advances in the education and industrial sectors. Sharif was instrumental in driving the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a part of China\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Belt and Road Initiative, and maintains a positive relationship with Beijing. A member of the wealthy Sharif dynasty, which amassed millions by producing steel, his family was mired in scandal after his brother Nawaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison and handed a $10.5 million fine over corruption charges in 2018. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan ousted as country's leader following vote of no-confidence Shehbaz Sharif rejected the verdict, calling it \u201a\u00c4\u00faflawed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapolitically motivated.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shehbaz Sharif is also facing charges for alleged corruption. In recent months, Sharif had led a campaign to remove Khan as Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader over claims of economic mismanagement and poor governance. Along with the opposition, he had urged Khan to resign ahead of a no-confidence vote that was widely expected to dismiss Khan. Tensions smoldered for days, with Khan repeatedly rejecting the criticism and instead claiming the moves against him were an attempt at regime change backed by Washington and some members of the opposition. The allegations were denied by both the US State Department and the Pakistani opposition. In a dramatic series of events, the deputy speaker in parliament blocked the no-confidence vote against Khan. Khan then dissolved parliament and called for early elections. The opposition challenged Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s moves in Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court, with Sharif calling them \u201a\u00c4\u00fanothing short of high treason.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The court ruled last week that the blocking of the no-confidence vote against Khan was unconstitutional, paving the way for Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rise to power.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The leading Democrat is asymptomatic, her spokesman said on Thursday. Mrs Pelosi, 82, was seen hugging former President Barack Obama during his visit to the White House on Tuesday and standing close to President Joe Biden. According to the latest US guidelines, quarantine is not required after Covid-19 exposure for those vaccinated.

Prosecutors say the men, some of whom are alleged militia members, targeted Gretchen Whitmer over Covid rules she imposed early in the pandemic. Lawyers for the accused say that the government's evidence is flimsy and have indicated an entrapment defence. The closely-watched trial is expected to last about six weeks. According to the FBI, which says it interrupted the plot 17 months ago, the men had planned to blow up a bridge near the governor's vacation home, then kidnap her and put her on a \"treason trial\". Ultimately 14 alleged plotters were arrested in late 2020. Six of the group were charged in a federal court. The other eight face separate state charges. Two of the men who faced federal charges have already pleaded guilty and are expected to testify against the remaining four at the trial. The undercover FBI agents that infiltrated the group are also expected to testify, and have been forced by a judge to reveal their real names over the objections of prosecutors. \"Making it crystal clear to the jury and the public that inside the courtroom, nothing is undercover and everything is out in the open will best ensure fairness during trial and eventual acceptance and respect for whatever the jury ultimately decides,\" Chief US District Judge Robert Jonker ruled on Thursday. Suspects Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, and Brandon Caserta, 33, are from Michigan, while Barry Croft, 46, is from the state of Delaware. All four are facing charges of kidnapping conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mr Croft and Mr Harris are also facing charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. Prosecutors say they will prove the men took specific steps towards achieving their plan, including travelling to the governor's home, testing explosives and training for combat against Gov Whitmer's security team. On Tuesday, around 100 potential jurors were indirectly asked about their personal politics, including whether they approve of Gov Whitmer and whether they view the 6 January Capitol riots as an \"insurrection\" or a \"legitimate political protest\". Rules ban lawyers from directly asking about political affiliation. The juror pool has been pulled from counties in northern Michigan, an area that skews Republican. The time of the FBI's swoop came as Ms Whitmer's lockdown orders drew thousands of protesters to the state capitol, where many legally entered government buildings with semi-automatic rifles and other firearms.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal was \u201a\u00c4\u00fatenable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal is a tenable one.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was \u201a\u00c4\u00faultimately one for the Polish government,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces. The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe prospect of fighter jets \u201a\u00c4\u00f2at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either. US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so. Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday. Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s. Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine. A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere (she) ought to have heard about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nuland told lawmakers. The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faready to deploy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec immediately and free of charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said. Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country. By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in \u201a\u00c4\u00fainteragency\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 discussions to \u201a\u00c4\u00faexamine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine. Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland. Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized. The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn fact, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re handing over to the Ukrainians? We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in very active discussions with them about that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said Sunday. A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely. Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.

Authorities said increased wildfire activity was due to \u201a\u00c4\u00facritical fire weather and high winds\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 detected Sunday along Interstate 35. Firefighters this past week have responded to 178 wildfires that burned 108,493 acres across the state, the statement said. As of Sunday, there were 23 active wildfires, Texas A&M Forest Service spokesperson Erin O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Connor said. The largest was the Eastland Complex Fire ripping through central Texas. The complex consists of seven fires totaling an estimated 54,463 acres and is now 60% contained, according to the interagency reporting website InciWeb. The seven fires in the Eastland Complex Fire are: The four initial fires that formed the Eastland Complex Fire began last Wednesday and Thursday, the forest service said. A total of 158 structures are reported destroyed, fire officials said. No differentiations have been reported between homes, businesses or outbuildings. The fires\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 causes are under investigation. On Friday, Gov. Greg Abbott said at least 50 homes across three communities had been destroyed. Some relief may come Monday afternoon as the region is expected to be in the path of severe storms and could get up to two inches of rain, CNN Meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. Statewide, the severe weather could impact up to 20 million Texans throughout the afternoon and evening hours, Shackelford added. Abbott directed the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s emergency management office to mobilize several units and put them on standby for rapid deployment, including two search and rescue teams and multiple swiftwater boat teams. At least one person has died as a result of the flames. Eastland County Deputy Sgt. Barbara Fenley died Thursday night as she helped evacuate people in the town of Carbon, about 100 miles west of Fort Worth. She was last heard from while on her way to assist an elderly person, the Eastland County Sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office said. Amid deteriorating conditions and low visibility from smoke, Fenley ran off the roadway and was killed in the flames, the sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office said. Abbott, who on Friday issued a disaster declaration for 11 counties, including Eastland, ordered flags be flown at half-staff in Fenley\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s honor. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will never forget her sacrifice,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the governor said.

The pioneering procedure was done to save his life, but could also revolutionise the field of organ transplantation, they hope. The donated thymus tissue should help stop his body rejecting the new heart. Months on from the surgery, tests reveal Easton is progressing well. The thymus tissue is working, meaning his body is building critical immune cells which might ultimately reduce or even eliminate the need for him to take lifelong anti-rejection drugs. One of his doctors, Joseph Turek from Duke University Hospital, said: \"We are very excited about it. This concept of tolerance has always been the holy grail in transplantation, and we are now on the doorstep. \"This has the potential to change the face of solid organ transplantation in the future.\" The thymus gland helps the development of T-cells, which fight foreign substances in the body. It teaches these immune cells what is \"self\" and what isn't, and therefore what can be attacked. Giving Easton cultured thymus tissue from the same donor who gave him a heart, should help his body adopt the new tissues, his doctors believe. Easton was born with a weak heart as well as problems with his immune system. He spent his first seven months in hospital - some of it on life support - and needed numerous heart operations. as well as treatment for recurrent infections that his body was unable to fight on its own. His mother, Kaitlyn Sinnamon, recalls: \"It helped some, but it was basically a band aid for us to make it through transplant.\" His doctors applied to the medical regulatory body, the FDA, to carry out an experimental type of transplant that hadn't been done in combination before, as far as they knew. Since Easton needed a new heart and, independently, a new thymus gland, the FDA granted approval for the procedures that went ahead in August 2021, when Easton was six months old. Dr Turek said: \"This was very serendipitous. We had the expertise to do both. \"The work we had done in the laboratory was based around using thymus along with heart transplantation in order to develop tolerance - so basically retraining the immune system and having the thymus of the same donor and heart grow up together. \"We thought this was an opportunity for Easton. This could be applied to all solid organs down the road potentially if this works.\" Much more research is needed before then, including checking if it is viable to remove and replace the thymus in people who have one that is already fully functioning. The medical team plan to wean Easton off the immunosuppressive drugs at some point, to see how he progresses. Kaitlyn said: \"I hope that as he gets older he gets to be proud of his scars, and know that he not only got to save his own life, but got to save other people's lives as well.\" US man gets pig heart in world-first transplant Pig kidney transplanted into brain-dead person Duke Health\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky.

Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians \u201a\u00c4\u00fahostage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration.

That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing \u201a\u00c4\u00faseveral civilians\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fasidelines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe will fight to the end,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s famous wartime speech. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrengthen the sanctions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a terrorist state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. Zelensky's heroism is coming up against Western red lines \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stoltenberg. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe situation could spiral out of control,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe other half largely from inside Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA little bit more than 70\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles have been fired from Belarus, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faonly a half dozen or so\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

Prosecutors say the men, some of whom are alleged militia members, targeted Gretchen Whitmer over Covid rules she imposed early in the pandemic. Lawyers for the accused say that the government's evidence is flimsy and have indicated an entrapment defence. The closely-watched trial is expected to last about six weeks. According to the FBI, which says it interrupted the plot 17 months ago, the men had planned to blow up a bridge near the governor's vacation home, then kidnap her and put her on a \"treason trial\". Ultimately 14 alleged plotters were arrested in late 2020. Six of the group were charged in a federal court. The other eight face separate state charges. Two of the men who faced federal charges have already pleaded guilty and are expected to testify against the remaining four at the trial. The undercover FBI agents that infiltrated the group are also expected to testify, and have been forced by a judge to reveal their real names over the objections of prosecutors. \"Making it crystal clear to the jury and the public that inside the courtroom, nothing is undercover and everything is out in the open will best ensure fairness during trial and eventual acceptance and respect for whatever the jury ultimately decides,\" Chief US District Judge Robert Jonker ruled on Thursday. Suspects Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, and Brandon Caserta, 33, are from Michigan, while Barry Croft, 46, is from the state of Delaware. All four are facing charges of kidnapping conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mr Croft and Mr Harris are also facing charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. Prosecutors say they will prove the men took specific steps towards achieving their plan, including travelling to the governor's home, testing explosives and training for combat against Gov Whitmer's security team. On Tuesday, around 100 potential jurors were indirectly asked about their personal politics, including whether they approve of Gov Whitmer and whether they view the 6 January Capitol riots as an \"insurrection\" or a \"legitimate political protest\". Rules ban lawyers from directly asking about political affiliation. The juror pool has been pulled from counties in northern Michigan, an area that skews Republican. The time of the FBI's swoop came as Ms Whitmer's lockdown orders drew thousands of protesters to the state capitol, where many legally entered government buildings with semi-automatic rifles and other firearms.

The decision was made during a Board of Governors meeting held earlier in the day in Los Angeles. The meeting, initially scheduled for April 18, was expedited after Smith announced his resignation from the Academy last week. Smith issued a quick, concise statement on his ban from the Oscars for the next decade. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI accept and respect the Academy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the actor said in a statement to CNN. CNN has reached out to Rock\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s representatives for comment.\u00d4\u00aa\u00f8 The decision came following \u201a\u00c4\u00fatons of debate\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on what the consequences of his on-stage slap should be, a board member tells CNN. The Academy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s letter added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year; however, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr. Smith exhibit on stage.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faDuring our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the letter went on to state. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFor this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short \u201a\u00c4\u00ee unprepared for the unprecedented.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Board of Governors said in a previous statement that they wanted the matter to be \u201a\u00c4\u00fahandled in a timely fashion.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Smith\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s resignation means that he is no longer part of the Academy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voting body, but it does not prevent the Oscar winner from being nominated in the future, a source with knowledge previously told CNN.\u00ac\u2020 Smith can also still be nominated despite being barred from attending the Oscars because \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe standards of conduct rules\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 at play in today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s action \u201a\u00c4\u00fado not apply to awards eligibility,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 a source close to the Academy with direct knowledge of the rules told CNN on Friday. Typically, the previous year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best actor winner presents the current year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best actress award (and the reigning best actress presents to the best actor trophy). With Smith\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ban, the Oscars will have to break that tradition. The actor struck Rock as the comedian was on stage presenting at the Academy Awards on March 27 after Rock had made a joke about Smith\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s, close-cropped hair. Pinkett Smith suffers from hair loss due to alopecia. Rock has not spoken in depth publicly about the incident. Days after it occurred, Rock appeared at a comedy show in Boston as part of his \u201a\u00c4\u00faEgo Death Tour\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and said \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have a bunch of s*** about what happened, so if you came to hear that, I had like a whole show I wrote before this weekend. And I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m still kind of processing what happened, so at some point I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll talk about that s***. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be serious and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be funny, but right now I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m going to tell some jokes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Smith publicly apologized to Rock the day after the incident via social media. Smith also reached out the next morning to the show\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s producer, Will Packer, apologized and expressed his embarrassment, the producer told \u201a\u00c4\u00faGood Morning America.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 During the interview with \u201a\u00c4\u00faGMA,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Packer said officers from the Los Angeles Police Department were prepared to arrest Smith for battery, but Rock said he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want that. In its letter, the Academy expressed \u201a\u00c4\u00fadeep gratitude to Mr. Rock for maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis action we are taking today in response to Will Smith\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the letter concluded. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Brian Stelter, Jason Kravarik and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

The measure comes as the country grapples with some of the worst housing affordability issues in the world. Prices have jumped more than 20%, pushing the average home in Canada to nearly C$817,000 ($650,000; \u00a3495,000) -  more than nine times household income. But industry analysts say it's not clear a ban on foreign buyers will address the problem. Data on purchases by foreign buyers in Canada is limited, but research suggests they amount for a small fraction of the market. \"I don't think\u00a0it's going to have a huge\u00a0impact,\" said Ben Myers, president of advisory firm Bullpenn Research & Consulting in Toronto, who found foreigners accounted for just 1% of purchases in 2020, down from 9% in 2015 and 2016. \"It's a fairly low number and let's face it, the people that really want to buy ... are going to find alternative ways to do it.\" Mr Myers said the soaring housing costs reflect strong population growth and a shortage of supply, due in part to rules that restrict development. The issues have worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers in Canada and elsewhere slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, lowering borrowing costs and boosting demand even further. The moves have fuelled the soaring housing prices seen in many markets around the world, but in Canada the disconnect between home prices and incomes is one of the most dramatic, according to OECD data. Mr Trudeau pledged to tackle housing affordability during his campaign for election last year. In addition to the temporary ban on foreign buyers, the budget proposal his government unveiled on Thursday sets aside billions to spur new construction and proposes new programmes, such as a tax-free savings account for first-time buyers. This video can not be played Why it takes 30 years to buy a house in Canada Mr Trudeau has also discussed banning certain bidding processes that favour investors, who by some measures have accounted for about one in five homes purchased in Canada since 2014. The proposed ban on foreign buyers would exempt permanent residents and foreign students and workers, as well as those buying their primary residence. The proposal builds on actions such as special taxes that some parts of Canada have already taken against out-of-town and foreign buyers. In Ontario, for example, provincial Premier Doug Ford recently announced plans to raise an existing tax on foreign buyers from 15% to 20% and expand it beyond Toronto to the entire province. While foreign purchases are not the driver of the affordability issues, taxing them at least captures revenue that can be re-deployed to address such problems, said Steve Pomeroy, head of Focus Consulting, a housing policy firm. \"If you ban them, you don't really have much of an impact on suppressing rising home prices and you give up the revenue,\" he said. New Zealand introduced a similar measure banning foreign buyers in 2018. \"It's good politics because it's easy to blame a victim that nobody cares about,\" Mr Pomeroy added. \"I don't think it will have much of an impact.\" Paul Kershaw, professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, also said he saw little in  Mr Trudeau's proposal likely to slow price increases or significantly address affordability. \"It's not clear the housing measures will be sufficient to break Canada's addiction to high and rising home prices,\" he said, noting that for existing homeowners, the high prices help amass wealth. Mr Pomeroy said he does expect price appreciation to slow in coming months, as the central bank raises interest rates. The Canadian housing market is particularly susceptible to such moves, since many buyers rely on five-year mortgages rather than the long-term ones common in the US and UK. But higher interest rates will only make it less affordable for prospective buyers trying to break into the market, he warned. Mr Myers said over the long-term, he expects hot markets such as Toronto and Vancouver to become dominated by renters, as regular buyers get priced out of the market, unless politicians address supply. But Mr Pomeroy said high development costs means that adding supply will not necessarily reduce prices, unless the additions are dramatic. \"Unless you've got born into the right family ... the prospects for young buyers are quite dim,\" he said.

Russia attempted to pay in rubles for two dollar-denominated bonds that matured on April 4, S&P said in a note on Friday. The agency said this amounted to a \u201a\u00c4\u00faselective default\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because investors are unlikely to be able to convert the rubles into \u201a\u00c4\u00fadollars equivalent to the originally due amounts.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 According to S&P, a selective default is declared when an entity has defaulted on a specific obligation but not its entire debt. Moscow has a grace period of 30 days from April 4 to make the payments of capital and interest, but S&P said it does not expect it will convert them into dollars given Western sanctions that undermine its \u201a\u00c4\u00fawillingness and technical abilities to honor the terms and conditions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of its obligations. A full foreign currency default would be Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first in more than a century, when Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated bonds issued by the Tsarist government. Russia cannot access roughly $315 billion of its foreign currency reserves as a result of Western sanctions imposed following its invasion of Ukraine. Until last week, the United States allowed Russia to use some of its frozen assets to pay back certain investors in dollars. But the US Treasury has since blocked the country from accessing its reserves at American banks, part of its effort to ramp up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and further diminish his war chest. JPMorgan estimates that Russia had about $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of last year, with about half of that held by foreign investors. Russia is now planning legal action. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will sue, because we undertook all necessary action so that investors would receive their payments,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will show the court proof of our payments, to confirm our efforts to pay in rubles, just as we did in foreign currency. It won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be a simple process,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. He did not say who Russia planned to sue. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a press conference last week that any default would be \u201a\u00c4\u00faartificial\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because Russia has the dollars to pay \u201a\u00c4\u00ee it just can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t access them. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are no grounds for a real default,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Peskov said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot even close.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Russia has gone to great lengths to artificially prop up the ruble \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which sank by as much as 40% to less than one US cent in the days after the invasion \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including by hiking interest rates to 20%, and by forcing exporters to swap most of their foreign currency revenues for rubles. That measure is still in place but the central bank has decided to relax some other restrictions, Reuters reported Monday, and last week announced that it was cutting interest rates to 17%. The ruble was trading at 79 to the US dollar on Monday, according to data from Refinitiv. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s about 5% weaker than on Saturday. \u201a\u00c4\u00ee David Goldman and Chris Liakos contributed reporting.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal was \u201a\u00c4\u00fatenable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal is a tenable one.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was \u201a\u00c4\u00faultimately one for the Polish government,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces. The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe prospect of fighter jets \u201a\u00c4\u00f2at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either. US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so. Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday. Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s. Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine. A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere (she) ought to have heard about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nuland told lawmakers. The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faready to deploy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec immediately and free of charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said. Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country. By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in \u201a\u00c4\u00fainteragency\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 discussions to \u201a\u00c4\u00faexamine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine. Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland. Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized. The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn fact, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re handing over to the Ukrainians? We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in very active discussions with them about that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said Sunday. A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely. Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.

Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, Brandon Caserta, 33, and Barry Croft, 46, each faced a kidnapping conspiracy charge. Mr Harris and Mr Caserta were found not guilty, but the charges against Mr Fox and Mr Croft ended in mistrial. The government had argued they targeted Gretchen Whitmer, 50, in a 2020 plot. Jurors began deliberating this week after 14 days of testimony and had indicated earlier on Friday that they were deadlocked on some of the charges. They ultimately reached no verdict against Mr Fox,  who was alleged to be the group's ringleader, and Mr Croft, both of whom were also facing an additional count each of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. In a statement sent by her office on Friday, Governor Whitmer thanked prosecutors and law enforcement for their work on the case and warned that \"Michiganders and Americans - especially our children - are living through the normalisation of political violence\". According to secret chats and private conversations revealed in court, members of the group - some of whom were said to be militia members - viewed Ms Whitmer as a \"tyrant\". Prosecutors said the men planned to abduct her from her holiday home, conduct some kind of \"treason trial\" and set her adrift in a boat on Lake Michigan. But lawyers for the accused countered that the scheme was mostly \"smoke and mirrors\", profane talk by angry and disillusioned men. Throughout the trial, they maintained that the men had been entrapped - or improperly induced into the crime - by an undercover FBI operation. The FBI has said it began tracking the group's movements after spotting online discussions of political violence. According to an FBI affidavit, an undercover source attended a June 2020 meeting in Ohio, where a group of Michigan-based militia members discussed overthrowing state governments \"that they believed were violating the US Constitution\". That October, the bureau announced the arrests of 13 alleged plotters. On the witness stand, two of the men - Ty Garbin, 26, and Kaleb Franks, 27 - said the participants acted of their own volition and were free to leave the group whenever they wanted. Both men had taken plea deals to avoid a prison sentence. FBI agent Timothy \"Red\" Bates also took the stand, testifying that the group discussed blowing up bridges near the governor's house to thwart law enforcement. But the defence alleged an FBI informant named Daniel \"Big Dan\" Chappel who infiltrated the group acted as a \"double agent\", befriending and radicalising the men to advance the plot. Mr Harris - the only defendant of the four to take the stand - slammed Big Dan as \"a liar\" who \"got scared by memes\" shared within the group. Mr Fox's lawyer also attacked Big Dan for \"[beating] the drum and [getting] them all worked up\".\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Chuck Grassley. Finkenauer pledged Monday to \u201a\u00c4\u00fachallenge this deeply partisan decision to the Iowa Supreme Court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Sunday night, Polk County District Judge Scott Beattie ruled that Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name \u201a\u00c4\u00fashall not be included on the primary ballot for the Democratic Primary for U.S. Senate.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The ruling centers around a dispute over the signatures required to get on the ballot. Although Finkenaur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign submitted more than the necessary 3,500 signatures, the judge found that she did not meet the requirement that each candidate have at least 100 signatures from at least 19 Iowa counties due to questions about three signatures obtained from Allamakee and Cedar counties. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Court takes no joy in this conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beattie wrote. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis Court should not be in the position to make a difference in an election, and Ms. Finkenauer and her supporters should have a chance to advance her candidacy. However, this Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s job is to sit as a referee and apply the law without passion or prejudice. It is required to rule without consideration of the politics of the day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finkenauer initially responded to the decision by saying her campaign was \u201a\u00c4\u00faexploring all of our options to fight back hard.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Later on Monday, Finkenauer announced she would challenge the decision with the Iowa Supreme Court. Finkenauer lawyer asks Iowa Supreme Court to return her to primary ballot in fight over signatures \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe refuse to back down in the face of these partisan attacks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are confident that we have met every requirement to be on the ballot, and we will not stop fighting back against this meritless attack that seeks to silence the voices of tens of thousands of Iowans.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Although Finkenauer has blamed Republicans for her signature issues, Democratic operatives in Iowa have been quietly aghast at how a statewide candidate, let alone someone who successfully ran for Congress recently, cut it so close on the signatures needed to make the ballot. The success of Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge will now rest with seven justices on Iowa\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00ec only one of whom was appointed by a Democrat. If Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge is unsuccessful, the former congresswoman could accept the ruling and run as a write-in candidate in the June primary. This could be complicated by the fact that although Finkenauer, a former congresswoman, was the front-runner in the Democratic field, she is running against two other Democrats: Glenn Hurst, a city council member in Minden, Iowa, and Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral. Republicans have been challenging Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signatures, initially bringing the complaint to the State Objections Panel. The state body decided in March that Finkenauer could stay on the ballot, but just narrowly. The panel found that Finkenauer submitted at least 100 signatures from 20 counties and needed 19. One of those counties was knocked out by the objection but she was able to squeak by with 100 signatures in one challenged county and 101 in two others. But Republicans successfully brought this lawsuit, saying the panel incorrectly interpreted the law. Iowa Republicans celebrated the decision on Monday, with Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann arguing that the questions surrounding Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signatures shows a \u201a\u00c4\u00fasevere lack of enthusiasm behind Iowa Democrats.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot qualifying for the ballot is a complete and utter embarrassment,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kaufmann said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Maxwell was convicted in December of sex trafficking and other charges for recruiting young women to be sexually abused by late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex crimes charges. After Maxwell was found guilty, the juror told reporters in interviews that he had shared his experience with the panel during deliberations. He described having swayed some jurors who were on the fence that an imperfect recollection of the abuse did not mean it didn't happen.

More than 900 civilians killed in a matter of weeks. Is Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal? His country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine has presented reams of evidence that have led some world leaders \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including US President Joe Biden last week \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to use the loaded label. The question now is what Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which he followed up by calling Putin a \u201a\u00c4\u00famurderous dictator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapure thug\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will mean for the war in Ukraine going forward. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t signal any concern that Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks would roil talks with Russia. He told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Fareed Zakaria that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faready for negotiations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with Putin. (More on this in a minute.) Biden's strategy with Putin is decades in the making Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments represented a major moment since leading officials had mostly avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. But soon after the President uttered the words \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think he is a war criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to reporters at an unrelated event, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the comment was \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom the heart.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Other officials used similar language. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hard not to walk away with that conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 State Department spokesman Ned Price later told CNN. And after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he \u201a\u00c4\u00fapersonally\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 agreed with Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s label of Putin, Psaki told reporters that the top US diplomat was speaking from the heart \u201a\u00c4\u00faas well.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Why all the parsing? While terms like \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar crimes\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are often used colloquially, they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Conventions, which specify intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime. In other words, the White House is being careful to not get ahead of the international investigations probing Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Will Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s words complicate Ukraine-Russia negotiations? The Kremlin called Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks about Putin being a war criminal \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Asked if it would be hard to sit down with Putin, Zelensky maintained Sunday that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ready \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and has been ready. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout delay,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 warning that otherwise Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s losses would be \u201a\u00c4\u00fahuge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The problem, as CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security team reports, is that US and NATO officials believe Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s engagement truly is \u201a\u00c4\u00ec even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Everything you need to know about war crimes and how Putin could be prosecuted The view from the State Department. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday also expressed her personal view that war crimes are being committed in Russia, saying that they \u201a\u00c4\u00faall feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but noted that there must be \u201a\u00c4\u00faa body of proof\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 before a legal determination can be made. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there is virtually no one \u201a\u00c4\u00ec maybe Vladimir Putin is the exception \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who can look at all of the photographs, all of video coming from Ukraine and not believe that Putin is intentionally targeting civilians, and intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in an interview with CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s John Berman on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow, I think we all feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sherman said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in terms of international law, you have to have evidence, you have to have a body of proof that in fact there was intentionality.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added that the United States is \u201a\u00c4\u00fahelping to pull that evidence together, present it to international justice parties and then have a legal threshold that is met.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 How long do war crime investigations take? Investigations at the International Criminal Court take many years, and only a handful of convictions have ever been won. Put differently, it could be a while before Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 remarks have any legal weight \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if ever. As we noted earlier this month, the court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAfter 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians \u201a\u00c4\u00fahostage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration.

CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response. A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been \u201a\u00c4\u00faisolated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it \u201a\u00c4\u00fain any significant way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days. Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe main issue today remains humanitarian aid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video. Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are \u201a\u00c4\u00faforced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, adding that Moscow is preventing \u201a\u00c4\u00fahumanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces \u201a\u00c4\u00faviolated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance in northern Ukraine. That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing \u201a\u00c4\u00faseveral civilians\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fasidelines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe will fight to the end,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s famous wartime speech. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrengthen the sanctions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a terrorist state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. Zelensky's heroism is coming up against Western red lines \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stoltenberg. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe situation could spiral out of control,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe other half largely from inside Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA little bit more than 70\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles have been fired from Belarus, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faonly a half dozen or so\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

Nathan Drew Morgan, 29, was shot by an unnamed 74-year old man last Tuesday after being pulled from Lake Keowee. An autopsy report ruled Morgan had died from a single gunshot to the chest aboard the man's pontoon boat. But Oconee County Sheriff's department said prosecutors had determined the shooting took place in self-defence. In a short statement, officials said 10th Circuit Solicitor David Wagner made the decision after meeting with investigators and asked \"for continued prayer for the family of Nathan Drew Morgan\". Lake Keowee is an extremely dangerous man-made reservoir which has seen a number of fatalities over the past 30 years. Officials from the sheriff's department said Morgan and an unnamed woman were in distress when discovered, having fallen off a Jet Ski into the water. Neither was wearing a life-jacket and the Jet Ski was circling. \"The man, who had been rescued, became agitated and began assaulting the couple on the pontoon,\" officers said in an earlier statement. \"Investigators have been told that the man may have wanted to get back to the Jet Ski.\" Sheriff Mike Crenshaw told the Journal of Seneca that Morgan may have been intoxicated. It was also alleged the women with Morgan pushed him back into the water in an attempt to defuse the situation, after which he was once again rescued by the 74-year-old man. However, Morgan was subsequently shot by the man, who claimed he feared \"for his and his wife's life while being assaulted\". The bizarre incident comes just three weeks after a jury in Florida voted to acquit a former police Swat commander who shot and killed a man who had thrown popcorn in his face during an altercation in a cinema.

A New Jersey man has been sentenced to 375 years in jail in the 2016 killing of three people, including two children, and attempted murder of three more after authorities say he became enraged over a Facebook post. Jeremy Arrington, 31, was convicted last month in Essex County of three counts of murder and attempted murder as well as burglary, criminal restraint and weapons charges. Jurors deliberated for less than two hours before handing down their decision. SACRAMENTO SHERIFF: DOWNTOWN SHOOTING THAT KILLED SIX IS RESULT OF \u2018TREATING CRIMINALS LIKE VICTIMS\u2019 On Friday, Judge Ronald Wigler imposed three consecutive life terms in the killings and consecutive sentences on other counts. Arrington won\u2019t be eligible for parole before serving 281 years of his sentence. Jeremy Arrington, 31, was sentenced to three life sentences for the three murder convictions and consecutive 50-year sentences for each of the three attempted murder convictions -- a total of 375 years. (New Jersey Office of the Attorney General) Wigler told the defendant that he had committed \"perhaps the most horrific, heinous, cruel, and depraved murders this county has ever seen.\" Prosecutors said Arrington entered a Newark home in November 2016, tied up the people inside and tortured them. He stabbed them with kitchen knives, killing 8-year-old Aerial Little Whitehurst and 11-year-old Al-Jahon Whitehurst, then shot and killed 23-year-old college student Syasia McBurroughs, who was visiting the family.

Authorities said Arrington was apparently angry that one of the victims had reposted a Facebook alert from police naming him as a suspect in an earlier shooting and sexual assault. While Arrington didn\u2019t take the stand at his trial, he read a short statement at his sentencing hearing on Friday, apologizing to the families. He described his actions as \"craziness and uncalled for\" and said he would switch places with the victims if he could,\u00a0NJ.com\u00a0reported. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Prosecutors also claimed that following her husband's death, Nancy made claims on 10 life insurance policies valued around $1.4 million for which she was the beneficiary, according to FOX 12 Portland.

One worshipper knocked the axe from the man's hands, and held him down until police arrived, local media reports. A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene in the suburb of Mississauga, and he has since been charged. Some congregants had minor injures from the bear spray, the mosque's imam said. One of the worshippers said the experience was \"terrifying\" and described hearing a scream before turning around to see a man holding an axe and using bear spray - similar to pepper spray - against three people. \"By the time he was spraying, the people in the first row realized something was going on and one of the young men turned around and knocked away the axe before he had a chance to use it,\" Noorani Sairally told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. The young man then held the alleged assailant down until police arrived, the witness said. \"Before he could inflict harm on any worshippers, several congregants bravely were able to stop him in his tracks,\" imam Ibrahim Hindy said in a statement, describing the moment the attacker entered the site. \"Our community will never be broken and we refuse to be intimidated,\" he added. Police have named the man they arrested as Mohammad Moiz Omar, and charged him with six offences including assault with a weapon and administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm. Following initial uncertainty over a possible motive, investigators now say they believe the attack was a \"hate-motivated incident.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of a number of high-profile Canadian public figures to condemn the attack, which he described as \"incredibly disturbing\" and applauded the courage of the worshippers at the mosque.

Ms Trump, 40, was asked for her account of her father's activities as the crisis unfolded. She was one of several aides said to have tried to convince the president to condemn the violence. Her appearance comes days after her husband Jared Kushner, also an ex-White House adviser, met investigators. The questioning lasted up to eight hours, US media reports. Unlike other witnesses called before the committee, Ms Trump never attempted to invoke her right to remain silent, according to the panel's top chairman. \"She's answering questions,\" congressman Bennie Thompson said. \"Not in a broad, chatty term, but she's answering questions.\" The committee has also subpoenaed White House records of Mr Trump's meetings and actions on 6 January, but documents acquired by BBC media partner CBS News show no presidential contacts for more than seven hours, as the battle in the Capitol was at its most intense. That runs counter to multiple reports of presidential phone calls to Republicans in the US Capitol, including a heated conversation with House minority leader Kevin McCarthy. Ms Trump could shed light on the methods her father used communicate that day. One Democratic member of the committee described Mr Kushner's testimony as \"helpful\" in reconstructing the events of the day.

Jackson said that she was a beneficiary of the Civil Rights Act passed in the decade before she was born, hardworking parents who gave her an African name \u201a\u00c4\u00ec \u201a\u00c4\u00faKetanji Onyika\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00falovely one\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and those who came before her, including Judge Constance Baker Motley, the first African American woman to be appointed to the federal bench. But Jackson, like some previous Supreme Court nominees, gave little hint of her personal judicial philosophy, saying she decides cases \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom a neutral posture\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and interprets the law \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout fear or favor, consistent with my judicial oath.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and the grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Jackson. Democrats touted President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pick as a qualified, boundary-breaking nominee, while some Republicans criticized her record on crime and the support she holds from left-wing groups. Jackson, 51, sits on DC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement. Jackson worked as a clerk for Breyer, a federal public defender, an attorney in private practice, a federal district court judge and a member of the US Sentencing Commission. At the hearing Monday, Jackson and the senators delivered their opening statements establishing the arguments for and against her confirmation. She was introduced by Judge Thomas Griffith, formerly of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Lisa Fairfax, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, her daughters Leila and Talia, and her husband Patrick were sitting behind her. Jackson will answer questions from the members on Tuesday and Wednesday, and witnesses will testify on Thursday. Democrats hope to confirm Jackson by early April. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, opened the hearing by putting Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination in historical context, noting that of 115 Supreme Court justices, 108 have been white men. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot a single justice has been a Black woman,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Durbin said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou, Judge Jackson, can be the first.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not easy being the first,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut your presence here today, your willingness to brave this process, will give inspiration to millions of Americans who see themselves in you.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 No Democratic senators have signaled they will oppose Jackson, and some Republicans have expressed openness to supporting her. In the 50-50 Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris could break a tied vote and confirm Jackson to the Supreme Court. READ: Ketanji Brown Jackson's opening statement at her Supreme Court confirmation hearing But many Republican senators are expected to oppose the nomination and some preemptively defended themselves from any criticisms that voting against Jackson would be perceived as sexist or racist, noting that Democrats have opposed diverse picks in the past because of their judicial philosophy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be looking to see whether Judge Jackson is committed to the Constitution as originally understood,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Republicans previewed on Monday their attempts to portray Jackson as weak on crime. Grassley said in his opening statement that there are two types of nominees who have worked criminal cases: \u201a\u00c4\u00faBill of Rights attorneys who want to protect defendants\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 constitutional rights\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facriminal defense lawyers who disagree with our criminal laws.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faOf course, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a very important difference,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Grassley said. Some Republican senators indicated that they will press Jackson for advocating on behalf of detainees at Guant\u221a\u00b0namo Bay in private practice after representing them as a public defender. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m a bit troubled by some of the positions you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve taken and arguments that you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made representing people who have committed terrorist acts against the United States and other dangerous criminals,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has raised concerns about Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s record on sentencing in child pornography cases. Hawley said on Twitter last week that there is \u201a\u00c4\u00faan alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s treatment of sex offenders, especially those preying on children.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Democrats have refuted Republicans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attacks since her nomination. When Biden gave a speech announcing his pick in February, he made sure to note that Jackson came from \u201a\u00c4\u00faa family of law enforcement, with her brother and uncles having served as police officers.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 GOP senators push misleading portrayal of Ketanji Brown Jackson's record on child porn cases The White House and Senate Democrats have pushed back on Hawley\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attack, noting that Jackson has the support of law enforcement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police, and dozens of former state attorneys general. They noted she has already been confirmed by the Senate three times. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn the vast majority of cases involving child sex crimes, the sentences Judge Jackson imposed were consistent with or above what the government or US probation recommended,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. A CNN review of the material in question shows that Jackson has mostly followed the common judicial sentencing practices in these kinds of cases and that Hawley took some of her comments out of context by suggesting they were opinions, rather than follow-up questions to subject-matter experts. It has become a norm among judges to issue sentences below the guidelines in certain child pornography cases that don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t involve producing the pornography itself. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSome have said that the federal sentencing guidelines are too harsh on child sex crimes, especially child pornography,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Hawley on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll just be honest. I can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say that I agree with that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 There are other matters Republicans may probe. During Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s confirmation hearings last year, some Senate Republicans focused on a 2019 case she heard between the House Judiciary Committee, which was looking into then-President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s possible obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Russia investigation, and former White House counsel Don McGahn. Ongoing cases involving Trump and the powers of government could land before her on the Supreme Court, including disputes over whether Congress can access Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial records and whether Trump could be held accountable by private litigants for the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Last year, Grassley challenged Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s declaration that \u201a\u00c4\u00fapresidents are not kings\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and suggested she was engaged in a kind of hyperbole. Senate Republicans have also pushed for Jackson to publicly oppose efforts to expand the court, which activists on the left have called for since they blocked then-President Barack Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 and then expanded, under Trump, the high court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conservative majority from 5-4 to 6-3. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination to replace another liberal will not change the ideological balance of the court. Confirmation hearings to spotlight rightward trajectory of America's highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00faNine is a number that works,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe must protect the court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Still, even those who may oppose Jackson expect the hearings this week to be less contentious than those in the Trump era, which altered the balance of the court and, in the case of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, centered on allegations of sexual assault. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMost of us couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go back to our offices during Kavanaugh without getting spit on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Graham to his Democratic colleagues. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI hope that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t happen to y\u201a\u00c4\u00f4all. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think it will.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jackson may receive some votes from Republicans. Last year, she received three \u201a\u00c4\u00ec from Graham, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u201a\u00c4\u00ec confirming her to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Graham preferred for Biden to choose Judge J. Michelle Childs from his home state and criticized the President for picking another Ivy League-educated nominee, claiming on Monday that Childs would\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve received \u201a\u00c4\u00fa60-plus\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 votes, including from himself. Jackson went to a public high school in Miami before earning both her undergraduate degree and law degree at Harvard University. Graham, like other Republicans, criticized Jackson for holding the support of left-wing groups. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re facing a choice sponsored by the most radical elements of the Democratic party when it comes to how to be a judge,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Graham said. Murkowski has said that her previous support of Jackson to be a judge does not signal how she would vote for Jackson to be a justice. But Collins has praised Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s credentials and experience as \u201a\u00c4\u00faimpressive.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Maine Republican said she would not make her decision until after the Judiciary Committee hearings.

The first arrivals since Russia's war began were shown wearing bright yellow suits with blue trimmings. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their fellow American, Russian and German crew. \"Sometimes yellow is just yellow,\" said the Roscosmos space agency.

A few hours later, two sets of hatches were opened and the three smiling men floated into the space station one by one in their yellow suits. The standard-issue Russian uniform is plain blue, and at least one of the men was seen wearing this before take-off.

But Roscosmos's press service dismissed the reports as a \"funny invention\" by foreign bloggers and media. \"The flight suits of the new crew are made in the colours of the emblem of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from... To see the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is crazy.\" The head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, is a strong supporter of the invasion and he suggested the claims that the cosmonauts were wearing Ukrainian colours had come from Ukrainian nationalists. Roscosmos later published another picture of Oleg Artemyev wearing an obviously Russian suit. The three Russians will begin a science mission on the ISS that is set to last just over six months. They will replace three current crew members who are scheduled to fly back to Earth on 30 March. The colours certainly speak to the moment, but what is the real motivation in wearing them? Does it signal support for Ukraine or the opposite? After all, the suits do display Russian flags. Perhaps neither view is correct. It has been suggested that the colours are a reflection of the fact that all three cosmonauts attended the Bauman Moscow State Technical University which has a similar colour scheme.  It's a \"Bauman crew\", the university has been trumpeting. The cosmonauts themselves, however, said noticeably little. What we do know is that 400km (248 miles) above the Earth, East and West have no choice but to continue friendly relations. While space co-operation is falling apart elsewhere - witness the ExoMars rover, for example - on the ISS the partners are joined at the hip. Russia provides the propulsion for the station, the Americans provide the power. The ISS cannot exist without either party. Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed?

Her attorneys have asked a judge to throw out the verdict, arguing they may have objected to his presence on the jury had they known of his history. The judge fired off dozens of questions to Juror No. 50 over his false answer on the questionnaire that had directly asked him whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse. He said he had \"skimmed way too fast\" through the screening form that all prospective jurors have to fill out. Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein in an undated evidence photo.

The measure comes as the country grapples with some of the worst housing affordability issues in the world. Prices have jumped more than 20%, pushing the average home in Canada to nearly C$817,000 ($650,000; \u00a3495,000) -  more than nine times household income. But industry analysts say it's not clear a ban on foreign buyers will address the problem. Data on purchases by foreign buyers in Canada is limited, but research suggests they amount for a small fraction of the market. \"I don't think\u00a0it's going to have a huge\u00a0impact,\" said Ben Myers, president of advisory firm Bullpenn Research & Consulting in Toronto, who found foreigners accounted for just 1% of purchases in 2020, down from 9% in 2015 and 2016. \"It's a fairly low number and let's face it, the people that really want to buy ... are going to find alternative ways to do it.\" Mr Myers said the soaring housing costs reflect strong population growth and a shortage of supply, due in part to rules that restrict development. The issues have worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers in Canada and elsewhere slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, lowering borrowing costs and boosting demand even further. The moves have fuelled the soaring housing prices seen in many markets around the world, but in Canada the disconnect between home prices and incomes is one of the most dramatic, according to OECD data. Mr Trudeau pledged to tackle housing affordability during his campaign for election last year. In addition to the temporary ban on foreign buyers, the budget proposal his government unveiled on Thursday sets aside billions to spur new construction and proposes new programmes, such as a tax-free savings account for first-time buyers. This video can not be played Why it takes 30 years to buy a house in Canada Mr Trudeau has also discussed banning certain bidding processes that favour investors, who by some measures have accounted for about one in five homes purchased in Canada since 2014. The proposed ban on foreign buyers would exempt permanent residents and foreign students and workers, as well as those buying their primary residence. The proposal builds on actions such as special taxes that some parts of Canada have already taken against out-of-town and foreign buyers. In Ontario, for example, provincial Premier Doug Ford recently announced plans to raise an existing tax on foreign buyers from 15% to 20% and expand it beyond Toronto to the entire province. While foreign purchases are not the driver of the affordability issues, taxing them at least captures revenue that can be re-deployed to address such problems, said Steve Pomeroy, head of Focus Consulting, a housing policy firm. \"If you ban them, you don't really have much of an impact on suppressing rising home prices and you give up the revenue,\" he said. New Zealand introduced a similar measure banning foreign buyers in 2018. \"It's good politics because it's easy to blame a victim that nobody cares about,\" Mr Pomeroy added. \"I don't think it will have much of an impact.\" Paul Kershaw, professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, also said he saw little in  Mr Trudeau's proposal likely to slow price increases or significantly address affordability. \"It's not clear the housing measures will be sufficient to break Canada's addiction to high and rising home prices,\" he said, noting that for existing homeowners, the high prices help amass wealth. Mr Pomeroy said he does expect price appreciation to slow in coming months, as the central bank raises interest rates. The Canadian housing market is particularly susceptible to such moves, since many buyers rely on five-year mortgages rather than the long-term ones common in the US and UK. But higher interest rates will only make it less affordable for prospective buyers trying to break into the market, he warned. Mr Myers said over the long-term, he expects hot markets such as Toronto and Vancouver to become dominated by renters, as regular buyers get priced out of the market, unless politicians address supply. But Mr Pomeroy said high development costs means that adding supply will not necessarily reduce prices, unless the additions are dramatic. \"Unless you've got born into the right family ... the prospects for young buyers are quite dim,\" he said.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal was \u201a\u00c4\u00fatenable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal is a tenable one.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was \u201a\u00c4\u00faultimately one for the Polish government,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces. The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe prospect of fighter jets \u201a\u00c4\u00f2at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either. US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so. Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday. Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s. Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine. A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere (she) ought to have heard about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nuland told lawmakers. The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faready to deploy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec immediately and free of charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said. Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country. By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in \u201a\u00c4\u00fainteragency\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 discussions to \u201a\u00c4\u00faexamine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine. Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland. Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized. The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn fact, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re handing over to the Ukrainians? We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in very active discussions with them about that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said Sunday. A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely. Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A 72-year-old woman accused of hate crimes against her Vietnamese neighbor has agreed to sell her Seattle-area home as part of a civil agreement with the victim and her family, according to reports. As per the agreement, Jan Myers, who is White, is expected to sell her home in Shoreline, Washington, about nine miles from downtown Seattle, within the next six months and pay the victim, Thi Pham, who is Vietnamese American, $45,000 from that sale, KGW reported. If Myers fails to move from the neighborhood before the time frame is up, the case could be referred to a civil jury. NYC TEEN CHARGED WITH HATE CRIME AFTER GROUP ATTACKS HASIDIC MAN IN BROOKLYN The ordeal began in April 2021 when Pham said she was outside in her front yard gardening when she noticed Myers sitting in the roadway staring at her and beginning to move her car back and forth. Fearful of what would happen next, Pham said she began recording and Myers is seen yelling several racial slurs and threats. Jan Myers is facing hate crime charges for alleged racially charged threats against her Vietnamese American neighbor Thi Pham\u00a0 (King County Sheriff's Office) In the video, Myers is heard calling Pham \"slant eye\" and \"Miss Vietnam\" and threatening \"you\u2019re not going to live very long.\" Pham called police afterward. Two weeks prior, Pham said Myers had walked onto her patio naked from the waist down making obscene gestures in front of her two-year-old son. Myers was charged with a hate crime in April 2021, but a judge released her without bail on her own recognizance shortly after. Pham and her husband, Bill Healy, filed a civil lawsuit in King County Superior Court in August 2021, claiming Myers violated a no contact order and continued to harass them. The couple alleged that Myers screamed at them outside and drove her car straight at Healy. Attorneys for Pham and Healy announced the civil settlement at a press conference Thursday. \"I am happy that I can safely live in my home without racial harassment,\" Pham said, according to KING-TV. \"We hope Jan Myers follow through the agreement and move quickly.\" \"That was what made it very difficult, is when I realized my wife and my family, their physical well-being and their life was being threatened by this person,\" Healy said, according to KIRO.

The Reed family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attempt to set up a meeting with Biden ahead of the visit was declined, they said. Reed\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family stood near the road waving as Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s motorcade passed by before the President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s speech. Paula Reed, Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s mother, said she saw Biden acknowledge her from his vehicle. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat was the whole purpose of coming out here, to get his attention,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, saying it was \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 worth it. A White House official said Biden called the Reeds \u201a\u00c4\u00fato reiterate his commitment to doing everything he can to bring their son home, to staying in close touch with them through his national security team and to finding a time to meet in person.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 After the speech, reporters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including a CNN producer \u201a\u00c4\u00ec at the scene with the Reed family could hear the President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voice on the cell phone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s speaker when he called. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t imagine what you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going through,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden could be heard saying during the call. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want you to think that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not something I constantly think about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds grew emotional and stepped away from reporters for the remainder of the conversation with the President, but Paula Reed shared with reporters details of the call after it had ended. She said Biden told them he felt terrible he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with them while he was in Texas and promised his scheduler would make an appointment for the family to meet with him in Washington. Biden told them he said a rosary for Trevor on his way to Texas, according to Paula Reed. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe was just very, very apologetic that he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. Reed added that Biden also told them he \u201a\u00c4\u00fathinks of Trevor every day and that he feels horrible that he hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to bring Trevor home yet. And he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to stop.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki had told reporters that a meeting could still happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00fa(W)e are working toward setting up a meeting with his family. The President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking forward to doing that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Psaki told reporters en route to Fort Worth aboard Air Force One. Trevor Reed has been detained in Russia since 2019. He was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the \u201a\u00c4\u00falife and health\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of Russian police officers after a night of drinking. He and his family have denied the charges and US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan called the trial \u201a\u00c4\u00fatheater of the absurd.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerned the invasion of Ukraine will worsen his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fate, along with that of Paul Whelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. The Reed family, who met with Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan last December, has said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been asking for the meeting with the President for months. Shortly after Psaki said a presidential meeting was in the works, Joey Reed told CNN the family has not had any new communication with the White House. Jon Franks, a spokesman for the Reed family, said Psaki\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statements were very welcome. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are grateful they seem to have reconsidered and await details. Just a reminder that the Reeds gratefully acknowledged their meeting with NSA Sullivan when it took place back in December. They look forward to gratefully acknowledging a meeting with their President,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Franks said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe want to talk to the President and say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the only man in the world who can bring him home and you can do it today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said Tuesday before the White House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Joey Reed said he heard Monday that the meeting during Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s trip on Tuesday would not happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we were told second hand was that there wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI know that every second is planned out for the President every day, but three minutes? Three or four minutes? I think he could spare that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trevor Reed has said in recent weeks that he is coughing up blood, and his family is concerned he has tuberculosis. Joey Reed said he spoke with his son as recently as Monday and asked Trevor if he wanted to pass along a message to Biden. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have anything to say to the President. I think that they have forgotten about me,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have not (forgotten about him). We love our son and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to fight to our dying day to bring him home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Brianna Keilar on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wednesday that they spoke with Trevor again Wednesday morning. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe called us again this morning. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been sounding horrible, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coughing constantly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd then we had even worse news this morning, he called and could barely talk. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s had some sort of accident and he believes he might have broken a rib.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed also said Trevor told them he would be sent to a hospital prison on Friday to be checked and while he believed Trevor has been honest about his health, expressed uncertainty that his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s injury was an accident. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt just seems to be getting worse and worse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Whelan, a former United States Marine, was sentenced to 16 years in prison on an espionage charge he vehemently denies. Whelan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family has said in recent days that the US should not forget about him and Reed as the US discusses Russian sanctions. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are watching the impact of sanctions, expected retaliation by the Russian Federation government, and making what contingency plans we can to support him,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Paul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s brother, David Whelan wrote in a statement released late last week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPaul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wrongful detention has always been about the Russian Federation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government extracting concessions from the US government.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the Russian Federation demands the concession of sanction removal, let Paul and Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s freedom be part of the price the Russian authorities pay in return,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 David Whelan added in the statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur family will be expressing this view to members of Congress, the State Department, and the White House.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. This week, the White House has turned some of its focus to Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention of American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner has been detained in Russia after customs officials detected cannabis oil in the athlete\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s luggage at an airport near Moscow, according to the Russian Federal Customs Service. According to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the administration is working on the process to get her out of Russia. The White House, so far, has publicly declined to discuss Griner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention or their potential efforts to secure her release. This story has been updated with additional reaction Wednesday.

The US Commerce Department has said the planes are in contravention of US sanctions on Russia. Providing service to these aircraft anywhere in the world - including inside Russia - may lead to heavy fines and potential jail time, it says. The list includes aircraft operated by Russian airlines, including Aeroflot. While most are Boeing aircraft, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovich - the current owner of Chelsea football club - is also included. The Russian was among seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government earlier this month in response to the Ukraine war. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. In a statement, the department said any refuelling, maintenance or repair work of any of the listed aircraft - as well as the provision of spare parts - violates US export controls. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was in response to \"Russia's brutal war of choice against Ukraine\". She added: \"We are publishing this list to put the world on notice - we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.\" The department said violators face \"substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions\". The regulations apply to any aircraft which has more than 25% US-origin content that was re-exported to Russia after new controls came into effect on 24 February, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. \"By preventing these aircraft from receiving any service, for example, including from abroad, international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded,\" the statement added. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said the US government hoped the move highlighted Russia's increasing isolation from the global economy. \"Our actions aren't idle words or dead letters on the page,\" he said. \"They have real teeth and as Putin's vicious war continues, they will continue to bite harder on the Russian and Belarusian economies\". The US, Canada and European allies have already banned Russian aircraft from operating in their airspace, forcing Russian airlines to largely abandon their international routes.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. The far side of the moon, which we can never see from our vantage point on Earth, looks surprisingly different than the orb we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re used to seeing in the night sky. The near side we are so familiar with appears darker in places \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the result of the vast ancient lava flows, called lunar mare \u201a\u00c4\u00ec while the far side is covered in pock marks and craters but no mare. Why the two sides of the moon are so different has long puzzled space scientists. However, a study published last week in the journal Science Advances has come up with a new explanation for this lunar mystery. Satellite pollution is threatening to alter our view of the night sky Researchers at Brown University studied the largest impact crater on the moon, known as the South Pole-Aitken basin (or SPA). Some 1,615  miles (2,600 kilometers) wide and five miles deep, it was formed by a massive space object that slammed into the moon \u201a\u00c4\u00ec perhaps a wayward dwarf planet \u201a\u00c4\u00ec when the solar system was being formed. The researchers found that the impact that formed the basin would have created a massive plume of heat that spread the moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interior, according to the statement. That plume would have carried certain materials to the moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nearside, fueling the volcanism that created the volcanic plains. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe know that big impacts like the one that formed SPA would create a lot of heat,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Matt Jones, a doctoral candidate at Brown University and the study\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lead author, in a news release. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe question is how that heat affects the Moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interior dynamics. What we show is that under any plausible conditions at the time that SPA formed, it ends up concentrating these heat-producing elements on the nearside. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe expect that this contributed to the mantle melting that produced the lava flows we see on the surface.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The volcanic plains on the near side of the moon are home to a group of elements including potassium, rare earth elements, phosphorous among others \u201a\u00c4\u00ec  known as Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) that is rare elsewhere on the moon. The researchers conducted computer simulations of how heat generated by a giant impact would alter patterns of heat transfer in the Moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interior, and how that might redistribute KREEP material in the lunar mantle. Rare NASA lunar dust collected by Neil Armstrong on the Apollo 11 mission is up for auction According to their model, the KREEP material would have ridden the wave of heat emanating from the impact zone \u201a\u00c4\u00falike a surfer\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 whether the impact was a direct hit or just grazed the moon. As the heat plume spread beneath the moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s crust, that material was eventually delivered to the nearside. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHow the PKT formed is arguably the most significant open question in lunar science,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jones said in the news release. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd the South Pole-Aitken impact is one of the most significant events in lunar history. This work brings those two things together, and I think our results are really exciting.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the measure, which would bar teachers from teaching these topics to children under 10 years old. Critics say the bill will isolate LGBT youth. Proponents say it is about empowering parents on education issues. Activists have dubbed it the Don't Say Gay bill. It is officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Bill. The Republican-backed legislation passed on Tuesday. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics \"when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\". White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday decried the passing of \"hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students\". President Joe Biden and his administration are \"with LGBTQI+ students everywhere\", she wrote on Twitter. State laws that ban or constrain the discussion of LGBT life in classrooms - sometimes called \"no promo homo\" laws by critics - are not uncommon. Four US states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas - currently have laws on the books that explicitly prohibit or limit sex education to heterosexual activity. The Florida bill also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Representative Joe Harding, who sponsored the bill in Florida's statehouse, has said that the bill is simply about \"empowering parents\". Critics say that vague language in the law could result in teachers and students being prevented from discussing their lives even outside the classroom. \"This is really about making it impossible for LGBT young people to speak for themselves,\" said Nadine Smith, the executive director of advocacy group Equality Florida. Todd and Jeff Delmay - one of the first same-sex couples to get married in Florida - say this bill would make it impossible for their 11-year-old son Blake to talk freely about his dads. \"We have fought and won these battles to adopt children and to be a family and to be together,\" Todd told the BBC. \"And they are now trying to find every way in which they can erase us and our families.\" And the couple warned the bill could marginalise LGBT youth as they  come to terms with their identity. \"A child's need for acceptance in a safe space should always take precedence over some parents' belief,\" Todd said, adding that legal challenges were already under way. The Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative group that supports the bill, said in a statement last week that it was \"necessary because government schools in the US have become ideological, political and are more interested in shaping a child's politics and sexual inclinations than they are in teaching academics of reading, writing, math, and education\". Governor DeSantis - widely regarded as a possible 2024 White House contender - endorsed the bill last month, saying it was part of a wider effort to make the education system \"transparent\" to parents. The Florida bill is part of a fierce debate taking place across the US over children's education, how schools operate and what they teach. Why are certain books being banned in US?

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal was \u201a\u00c4\u00fatenable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal is a tenable one.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was \u201a\u00c4\u00faultimately one for the Polish government,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces. The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe prospect of fighter jets \u201a\u00c4\u00f2at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either. US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so. Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday. Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s. Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine. A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere (she) ought to have heard about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nuland told lawmakers. The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faready to deploy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec immediately and free of charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said. Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country. By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in \u201a\u00c4\u00fainteragency\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 discussions to \u201a\u00c4\u00faexamine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine. Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland. Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized. The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn fact, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re handing over to the Ukrainians? We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in very active discussions with them about that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said Sunday. A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely. Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.

After a review of the case, Starr County District Attorney Gocha Allen Ramirez concluded that the woman \u201a\u00c4\u00facannot and should not be prosecuted for the allegation against her,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the DA said in a statement. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unclear whether the woman, who CNN is not naming, had an abortion herself or had in some way assisted in one. CNN reached out to Calixtro Villarreal, an attorney for the woman, and was told he would not be commenting on the matter. The Texas woman was initially indicted on a murder charge after \u201a\u00c4\u00faintentionally and knowingly caus[ing] the death of an individual by self-induced abortion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the statement from Maj. Carlos Delgado of the Starr County Sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office, obtained by CNN affiliate KRGV. Ramirez will file the motion to dismiss the indictment on Monday, his statement said, but stressed that the sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office acted according to its responsibilities under the law. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn reviewing this case, it is clear that the Starr County Sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Department did their duty in investigating the incident brought to their attention by the reporting hospital. To ignore the incident would have been a dereliction of their duty,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ramirez\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement reads. \u201a\u00c4\u00faProsecutorial discretion rests with the District Attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office, and in the State of Texas a prosecutor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s oath is to do justice. Following that oath, the only correct outcome to this matter is to immediately dismiss the indictment,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ramirez adds. CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s calls and emails to Delgado and the sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office were not returned on Saturday or Sunday. The woman was arrested Thursday and detained in Starr County on a $500,000 bond, the sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement says. She was released on Saturday, according to the Frontera Fund, an abortion advocacy organization in the Rio Grande Valley that has taken a strong interest in her case. The woman\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lawyer did not respond to CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s request for comment Saturday and Sunday. Messages were also left with representatives from the Frontera Fund over the weekend. Explainer: What is the Texas abortion ban and why does it matter? News of the arrest provoked outrage from abortion-rights supporters in light of Texas\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 strict abortion legislation passed last year. One new law bans abortion providers from carrying out terminations after early cardiac activity is detected in a fetus. A second law signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in September prohibits a person \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom providing an abortion-inducing drug to a pregnant woman without satisfying the applicable informed consent requirements for abortions.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ramirez acknowledged in his statement that \u201a\u00c4\u00fait is clear to me that the events leading up to this indictment have taken a toll\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on the woman and her family. \u201a\u00c4\u00faTo ignore this fact would be shortsighted. The issues surrounding this matter are clearly contentious, however based on Texas law and the facts presented, it is not a criminal matter,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ramirez said.

Specifically Ari Wegner, a name you're going to be hearing a lot more often from now on. It may be 2022, but the combination of both a female director and a female director of photography is still a rare occurrence in Hollywood. The pair combined to create an unsettling and menacing western which tackles toxic masculinity and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as complicated, malevolent cowboy Phil, who forms an unlikely friendship with a younger man, Pete (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The film is leading the pack at this year's Academy Awards with 12 nominations, including best picture, best director and best cinematography - Wegner could be the first woman to win the latter. For many, that female recognition is cause for celebration after the so-called \"male gaze\" has dominated Hollywood for so long. But is there such thing as \"the female gaze\" and if so, what does that bring to a traditionally male genre like a western? Campion, who is now the first woman to be nominated for two best director Oscars, isn't sure. \"It's so hard to know how much to believe in the female gaze or the male gaze,\" she tells the BBC. \"I think, to me, it's really the artist's gaze, bringing your sensitivity to the story. [But] I really wanted to have a woman cinematographer on this film, because there's so many other men and I really like to support women.\" Wegner, who previously worked with Campion on a commercial, told the BBC's culture editor Katie Razzall: \"There probably is a gender element to it, but it's also just what interests you, what your upbringing is, what you notice. \"And I think maybe Jane and I are similar in that way, really fascinated by subtle kinds of energy between people and what's not being said.\" Campion says it's thanks to the film's \"feminist\" producer Roger Frappier that she got on board with the project in the first place after a meeting in Cannes. \"It's very lucky that he really trusted me with this story, which you would think is a book for the kind of big-guy type of person that would handle ranch material - even though I do ride horses, and my parents did have cattle on the farm (Campion grew up in New Zealand). \"I was grateful to him for believing in me. And I was grateful to Savage's book, which is kind of subversive... when you think about most western genre movies, they're really a kind of celebration of masculinity in one way or another... and often a romanticised version of what a man is. \"In Savage's hands, he ripped through it really, and showed us a very true and different version.\" His version is one Campion and Cumberbatch have faithfully brought to life on screen through the latter's swaggering, snarling and insidious presence. The film also stars real-life couple Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst as Phil's brother and his wife Rose, who is also Pete's mother. The film is Campion's first in more than a decade and has been largely well received by critics, with The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw describing it as \"one of Campion's best\" and Empire's Beth Webb noting that while the \"narrative here feels somewhat underdeveloped... Campion remains a master of sensory storytelling\". The Netflix film is another feather in the streaming giant's cap, but Cumberbatch recently told Vanity Fair he wished the film had enjoyed a longer cinema release (it had a finite two-week run before it headed exclusively to Netflix). Campion concurs. \"I'd have loved it to have been out in the cinema for longer but that wasn't the plan that Netflix had. However, I would have to say that we wouldn't have made the film at all without Netflix. They were the only people that were willing to pay what this film cost to make and they are incredibly supportive.\" She adds that Netflix are now putting the film out in cinemas again \"because of the 12 nominations that we got and you know, the general interest in it and people wanting to see it on a big screen\". Campion also points out that streaming brings the film - which is essentially an arthouse one - to a bigger and wider audience, making it more accessible.  And she's delighted with the attention it's getting, including the awards buzz. \"I'm kind of thrilled. I feel like I've had kind of a comeback. I do feel really quite moved. People in the Academy have voted for so many categories.\" She also understands it has greater significance for women in the industry as a whole after the shocking revelations about the abuse of women in Hollywood including the Harvey Weinstein scandal. \"I really feel that the MeToo movement changed everything. I think it was a very dark time in the late 90s. And up to about 2015. It was almost as if nobody was hearing the fact there was such a depth of inequality. \"And when those brave ladies shared their stories... everybody woke up and went: 'It's really been impossible, and it's incredibly unequal, and we're not going to have it.' \"It's just not OK to have so little representation of women in film and TV. I think women are doing so well. It's no longer charitable to be employing women. And that's the big change. We want to be recognised because we are really good!\" Wegner is also blazing a trail on the awards circuit. As well as the Oscar nomination, she is the first woman ever to receive a Bafta nod for best cinematography. \"I think the visibility really matters because everyone's the harshest critic of their own work, but it is something very meaningful to be recognised by your peers,\" she told Razzall. The Australian says she was \"so na\u00efve\" when she first decided to go into her field. \"I had no idea that it was not a job that women usually did. It wasn't really until later in film school that I heard this term female cinematographer. And it slowly dawned on me that there were very few but... it was too late. I'd already decided [my career].\" The most recent annual Celluloid Ceiling report found that women comprised 21% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers working on the top 100 grossing films in 2020, up from 20% in 2019. Women also make up 50% of movie-goers. Campion says: \"We just have to keep going this way. It can never go back to what it was. It was a really dark time when people didn't want to see what women thought or made films about but now there's a real appetite amongst audiences, men and women. \"Netflix are actively seeking to keep their ratio of material made by women up. It's acts like that that make a real difference. \"And hiring Ari for an ambitious film like this one. Is that a risk? Well, I don't think it was a risk. She's really talented. All she needed was people that believe in her and to give her that opportunity, supporting her to make sure she does succeed. And she did succeed.

Another bill, which requires K-12 students to use bathrooms designated for their biological sex, included a last-hour amendment Thursday critics have compared to similar legislation in Florida dubbed the \u201a\u00c4\u00faDon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 law. It would ban classroom discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools. The state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Representatives also approved SB 184, which would make it a class C felony for medical professionals to provide gender-affirming care \u201a\u00c4\u00ec such as hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender-reassignment surgery \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to people 18 and younger. Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bills into law Friday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are very real challenges facing our young people, especially with today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s societal pressures and modern culture. I believe very strongly that if the Good Lord made you a boy, you are a boy, and if he made you a girl, you are a girl. We should especially protect our children from these radical, life-altering drugs and surgeries when they are at such a vulnerable stage in life. Instead, let us all focus on helping them to properly develop into the adults God intended them to be,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, according to a statement from her press office. Senate Bill 184 states medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care could face up to 10 years in prison. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe decision to pursue a course of hormonal and surgical interventions to address a discordance between the individual\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sex and sense of identity should not be presented to or determined for minors who are incapable of comprehending the negative implications and life-course difficulties attending to these interventions,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the bill reads. Book bans move to center stage in the red-state education wars The legislation would also make it a violation for public or private school officials, such as teachers, principals, nurses and counselors to encourage a minor to withhold from their parent or guardian \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe fact that the minor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s perception of his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with the minor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sex.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The bill, dubbed the Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, passed the Republican-controlled House following a 66-28 vote, according to the state legislature\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s website. The GOP-led Senate passed the bill 24-6 in February, and it will become law 30 days after the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signature. Alabama would be the latest state to enact such a measure. Last year, Republican lawmakers in Arkansas overrode a veto from their governor to put their own health care ban on the books, and Tennessee and Arizona have passed similar bans. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued Arkansas over its ban last year, and in July, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the law. The ACLU, the ACLU of Alabama and other legal advocacy groups announced plans to file a legal challenge to the bill. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur representatives have been hearing from medical experts, parents, transgender youth, and other advocates for the past three years in an attempt to stop this harmful bill from passing. But despite this strong opposition, the Legislature seems determined to move ahead with this shameful effort to prevent parents and kids from deciding the best course of treatment for themselves,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Kaitlin Welborn, staff attorney for the ACLU of Alabama. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the state moves forward in passing this unconstitutional bill, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll see them in court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Later, the legislature passed a bill requiring K-12 students to use bathrooms designated for their biological sex. House Bill 322 also includes a late amendment banning classroom discussions or instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools. Kentucky's Democratic governor vetoes anti-trans sports ban An original version of the bill sought \u201a\u00c4\u00fato require public K-12 schools to designate the use of rooms where students may be in various stages of undress upon the basis of biological sex.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Just before the final vote Thursday afternoon, Republican state Sen. Shay Shelnutt introduced an amendment to \u201a\u00c4\u00faprohibit classroom instruction or discussion on sexual orientation or gender identity for students in kindergarten through the fifth grade.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shelnutt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s amendment also declares schools should not \u201a\u00c4\u00faengage in classroom discussion or provide classroom instruction regarding sexual orientation or gender identity in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The bill, including Shelnutt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s amendment, passed the state Senate in a 26-5 vote. After the bill was sent back to the House for a concurrence vote, the amendment was adopted Thursday night following a 70-26 vote. The bill now heads to Ivey for final approval, according to Julie Saint, supervisor for enrolling and engrossing for the Alabama House of Representatives. Opponents of the measure condemned its passage, with the ACLU of Alabama saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt also invokes legislation similar to Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s controversial \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 bill by banning classroom instruction or discussion of gender identity in public elementary schools.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The legislation violates the US Constitution and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, the ACLU said. The Human Rights Campaign issued a statement Thursday night, \u201a\u00c4\u00fatransgender students will bear the cost of the discrimination \u201a\u00c4\u00ec discrimination which already causes transgender youth to feel unsafe in school, suffer academically, and have a higher likelihood of dropping out of school.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The governor said signing the bill was a \u201a\u00c4\u00fano-brainer.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faLet me be clear to the media and opponents who like to incorrectly dub this the \u201a\u00c4\u00faDon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 amendment: That is misleading, false and just plain wrong,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ivery said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t need to be teaching young children about sex.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The organizer of a Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT) meeting at the University of North Texas (UNT) says campus police escorted her into a janitor's closet for her own safety after activists disrupted the event featuring Texas House of Representatives candidate Jeff Younger. Younger is the father of a 7-year-old child, who was born James but now goes by Luna, at the center of a 2019 custody battle that attracted national attention\u00a0after his mother encouraged the boy to medically transition into a girl. A Texas judge granted Younger's ex-wife full custody of the child and a sibling in 2019. \"We actually had invited guests for all of our general biweekly meetings. We looked at local political candidates, we looked at local, conservative YouTubers. \u2026 We were just looking at anyone who'd be interesting and who was nearby,\" Kelly Neidert, a 22-year-old senior at UNT and founder of the school's registered YCT chapter, told Fox News Digital. University of North Texas (Google Maps) \"We had heard of Jeff [Younger] before and found out he was actually running for a House district, so we just thought: he has this backstory. He's also running for an election. So he seemed like a good fit, and he was willing to come in,\" she continued. ANTIFA PROTESTERS DISRUPT TEXAS COLLEGE CAMPUS PRO-LIFE PRAYER VIGIL: \u2018F--- YOUR GOD!\u2019 But the March 2 event featuring the conservative congressional candidate and critic of transgender ideology turned into chaos when dozens of activists showed up to the event and scared away other non-disruptive students, Neidert said, adding that about 70% of the 80 attendees \u2014 the maximum capacity \u2014 in the classroom were protesters. Videos posted to Neidert's Twitter and TikTok accounts show protesters screaming, talking over speakers, drawing on a whiteboard in the classroom and taking other disruptive actions. In one video, Younger laughs as one protester screams while he is speaking. About 40 minutes into the meeting, Neidert said things got so chaotic that campus police had to help her and a fellow YCT member exit the room. Once they left the building, they were met with more protesters waiting outside who attempted to follow Neidert and the other YCT member, the 22-year-old said. Officers escorted Neidert\u00a0to a janitor's closet inside another building until eventually leading her back outside and into a police vehicle. TEXAS PROFESSOR SUES UNIVERSITY AFTER BEING PUNISHED FOR SAYING MUSIC THEORY ISN'T RACIST Neidert\u00a0said she had already coordinated with police prior to the event because she had been receiving \"death threats and threats of violence\" at school prior to the event. In a March 3 statement, UNT President Neal Smatresk said campus police bolstered security for the event ahead of time \"[b]ecause conversations surrounding the student organization\u2019s event, which focused on criminalizing healthcare for transgender children, have been contentious,\" adding that \"a few hundred protesters\" had gathered outside the building where the meeting was held since the event was limited to 80 attendees. He added that police \"believe a small group of protestors not affiliated with the university contributed to escalating the overall protest from peaceful to an aggressive encounter.\" \"A group of protestors surrounded the police vehicles containing both the student organizers and their guest and attempted to block their exit from the scene by banging on the vehicles and impeding their movement,\" Smatresk\u00a0said. \"The officers engaged emergency lights and sounded warning sirens repeatedly while inching forward as other officers assisted in clearing a path for the vehicles to exit safely.\" He continued: \"We have always touted the importance of freedom of expression and been proud of our students\u2019 ability to speak up for themselves and participate in nonviolent protest. UNT Police have continuously worked to create and maintain an environment safe for all students to express themselves, regardless of topic.\" The incident did not result in any injuries, according to the school president.

The Oxford indie group's song spent 59 weeks on its slow ascent to the summit of the Billboard Hot 100. The previous record was held by Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, on 35 weeks. \"I absolutely can't believe it,\" singer Dave Bayley said. \"For it to do this means the absolute world.\" He added in a Twitter message to fans: \"This song came out at the beginning of the pandemic and we didn't think it would really go anywhere because of that, and it has because you guys have embraced it so much.\" There are slow-burning hits, then there's Heat Waves - a song that took longer to reach room temperature than an ice age mammoth. The song's 59-week trek to the top of the US Billboard chart eclipses the previous record-holder, Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, by a massive 24 weeks. With just one song, Glass Animals have spent 27 more weeks on the chart than The Prodigy have managed in their entire career. The Oxford band also became the first UK group to break into Spotify's global top 10 since Clean Bandit in 2018 (Coldplay have since made the chart, too). The song had all the right ingredients for a sleeper hit. Glass Animals were well respected in the industry, with a Mercury Prize nomination for their second album How To Be A Human Being - but they weren't big enough to have their song automatically added to radio station and streaming service playlists. It took months for Heat Waves to cross over from alternative radio to pop stations, building up a bigger head of steam as it went. Streaming also played a crucial part in its success. Songs tend to have a longer half-life now than 10 years ago, as fans continue to play their favourite tracks, keeping them afloat for months on end. Glass Animals were also given a late boost by TikTok, where creator Juliette Cullen used Heat Waves to soundtrack a viral video about a lack of curly fries in certain branches of McDonald's. The band have joked its success is all down to Bayley's mum streaming it on a loop\u2026 but given that the song's been played 1.3 billion times on Spotify alone, she'd had to have started 9,900 years ago. In reality, it's just a great song - one whose vibey production and low-key hooks reveal new treasures on each listen. Hopefully its success will encourage people to seek out the rest of the band's equally-rewarding back catalogue. The song, which was originally released as a single in June 2020, first snuck into the US singles chart in 100th place in January 2021. Allow YouTube content?

Most weeks ever to reach US number one: Heat Waves peaked at number five in the UK in October 2021. Bayley, who wrote and produced the grower, told the BBC it had its genesis as far back as May 2018. \"We were winding down from touring our second album and I hired a studio in north London called The Church,\" he explained last year. \"I was in the little basement room, which used to be the kitchen - and I've recently found out that's where Bob Dylan used to sit and write. He only wanted to be in the kitchen, apparently. \"Anyway, I spent all day there\u2026 but I was fishing and catching rubbish.

Jackson said that she was a beneficiary of the Civil Rights Act passed in the decade before she was born, hardworking parents who gave her an African name \u201a\u00c4\u00ec \u201a\u00c4\u00faKetanji Onyika\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00falovely one\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and those who came before her, including Judge Constance Baker Motley, the first African American woman to be appointed to the federal bench. But Jackson, like some previous Supreme Court nominees, gave little hint of her personal judicial philosophy, saying she decides cases \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom a neutral posture\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and interprets the law \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout fear or favor, consistent with my judicial oath.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and the grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Jackson. Democrats touted President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pick as a qualified, boundary-breaking nominee, while some Republicans criticized her record on crime and the support she holds from left-wing groups. Jackson, 51, sits on DC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement. Jackson worked as a clerk for Breyer, a federal public defender, an attorney in private practice, a federal district court judge and a member of the US Sentencing Commission. At the hearing Monday, Jackson and the senators delivered their opening statements establishing the arguments for and against her confirmation. She was introduced by Judge Thomas Griffith, formerly of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Lisa Fairfax, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, her daughters Leila and Talia, and her husband Patrick were sitting behind her. Jackson will answer questions from the members on Tuesday and Wednesday, and witnesses will testify on Thursday. Democrats hope to confirm Jackson by early April. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, opened the hearing by putting Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination in historical context, noting that of 115 Supreme Court justices, 108 have been white men. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot a single justice has been a Black woman,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Durbin said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou, Judge Jackson, can be the first.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not easy being the first,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut your presence here today, your willingness to brave this process, will give inspiration to millions of Americans who see themselves in you.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 No Democratic senators have signaled they will oppose Jackson, and some Republicans have expressed openness to supporting her. In the 50-50 Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris could break a tied vote and confirm Jackson to the Supreme Court. READ: Ketanji Brown Jackson's opening statement at her Supreme Court confirmation hearing But many Republican senators are expected to oppose the nomination and some preemptively defended themselves from any criticisms that voting against Jackson would be perceived as sexist or racist, noting that Democrats have opposed diverse picks in the past because of their judicial philosophy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be looking to see whether Judge Jackson is committed to the Constitution as originally understood,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Republicans previewed on Monday their attempts to portray Jackson as weak on crime. Grassley said in his opening statement that there are two types of nominees who have worked criminal cases: \u201a\u00c4\u00faBill of Rights attorneys who want to protect defendants\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 constitutional rights\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facriminal defense lawyers who disagree with our criminal laws.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faOf course, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a very important difference,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Grassley said. Some Republican senators indicated that they will press Jackson for advocating on behalf of detainees at Guant\u221a\u00b0namo Bay in private practice after representing them as a public defender. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m a bit troubled by some of the positions you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve taken and arguments that you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made representing people who have committed terrorist acts against the United States and other dangerous criminals,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has raised concerns about Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s record on sentencing in child pornography cases. Hawley said on Twitter last week that there is \u201a\u00c4\u00faan alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s treatment of sex offenders, especially those preying on children.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Democrats have refuted Republicans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attacks since her nomination. When Biden gave a speech announcing his pick in February, he made sure to note that Jackson came from \u201a\u00c4\u00faa family of law enforcement, with her brother and uncles having served as police officers.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 GOP senators push misleading portrayal of Ketanji Brown Jackson's record on child porn cases The White House and Senate Democrats have pushed back on Hawley\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attack, noting that Jackson has the support of law enforcement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police, and dozens of former state attorneys general. They noted she has already been confirmed by the Senate three times. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn the vast majority of cases involving child sex crimes, the sentences Judge Jackson imposed were consistent with or above what the government or US probation recommended,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. A CNN review of the material in question shows that Jackson has mostly followed the common judicial sentencing practices in these kinds of cases and that Hawley took some of her comments out of context by suggesting they were opinions, rather than follow-up questions to subject-matter experts. It has become a norm among judges to issue sentences below the guidelines in certain child pornography cases that don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t involve producing the pornography itself. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSome have said that the federal sentencing guidelines are too harsh on child sex crimes, especially child pornography,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Hawley on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll just be honest. I can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say that I agree with that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 There are other matters Republicans may probe. During Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s confirmation hearings last year, some Senate Republicans focused on a 2019 case she heard between the House Judiciary Committee, which was looking into then-President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s possible obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Russia investigation, and former White House counsel Don McGahn. Ongoing cases involving Trump and the powers of government could land before her on the Supreme Court, including disputes over whether Congress can access Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial records and whether Trump could be held accountable by private litigants for the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Last year, Grassley challenged Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s declaration that \u201a\u00c4\u00fapresidents are not kings\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and suggested she was engaged in a kind of hyperbole. Senate Republicans have also pushed for Jackson to publicly oppose efforts to expand the court, which activists on the left have called for since they blocked then-President Barack Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 and then expanded, under Trump, the high court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conservative majority from 5-4 to 6-3. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination to replace another liberal will not change the ideological balance of the court. Confirmation hearings to spotlight rightward trajectory of America's highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00faNine is a number that works,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe must protect the court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Still, even those who may oppose Jackson expect the hearings this week to be less contentious than those in the Trump era, which altered the balance of the court and, in the case of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, centered on allegations of sexual assault. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMost of us couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go back to our offices during Kavanaugh without getting spit on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Graham to his Democratic colleagues. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI hope that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t happen to y\u201a\u00c4\u00f4all. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think it will.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jackson may receive some votes from Republicans. Last year, she received three \u201a\u00c4\u00ec from Graham, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u201a\u00c4\u00ec confirming her to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Graham preferred for Biden to choose Judge J. Michelle Childs from his home state and criticized the President for picking another Ivy League-educated nominee, claiming on Monday that Childs would\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve received \u201a\u00c4\u00fa60-plus\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 votes, including from himself. Jackson went to a public high school in Miami before earning both her undergraduate degree and law degree at Harvard University. Graham, like other Republicans, criticized Jackson for holding the support of left-wing groups. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re facing a choice sponsored by the most radical elements of the Democratic party when it comes to how to be a judge,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Graham said. Murkowski has said that her previous support of Jackson to be a judge does not signal how she would vote for Jackson to be a justice. But Collins has praised Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s credentials and experience as \u201a\u00c4\u00faimpressive.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Maine Republican said she would not make her decision until after the Judiciary Committee hearings.

The announcement sent Twitter shares soaring by more than 27% in New York trading on Monday. Tesla's chief executive owned 73,486,938 shares in the social media platform as of 14 March, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stake is worth $2.89bn (\u00a32.2bn), based on Twitter's closing price on Friday. It makes him the largest shareholder in the company, with more than four times the 2.25% holding of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Mr Musk is a regular Twitter user with more than 80 million followers, although recently he said he is giving \"serious thought\" to building a new social media platform. Late last month, Mr Musk asked his followers whether they thought the social media platform encouraged free speech. \"Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.

Edward Kassig held back tears as he read a letter from his son, Peter Kassig, one of four Americans killed by the terror cell known as the Beatles. Alleged member El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, is accused of kidnapping and conspiracy. He has denied all charges. The elder Mr Kassig is the latest family member of victims to give evidence at the trial of Mr Elsheikh, who is the highest profile IS fighter to face justice in a US court. Describing his son's final letter, Mr Kassig said: \"This was a young man knowing his time had come. It was his farewell.\" Then he read the letter. \"I spent a long time taking life for granted and taunting death,\" his 26-year-old son wrote. \"I have never wanted to live more. I don't want you and Mum ruined over this.\" He said he \"cried a lot in the first few months, but not anymore\". Prosecutors in the case argue that Mr Elsheikh was deeply involved in ransom demands from the families of hostages, and the executions the so-called Beatles carried out. The defence, however, have said that the Sudanese-born Londoner was not part of the group and merely \"a simple Isis fighter\". Several family members of victims have testified about email exchanges with Beatle captors as part of the prosecution's case. Ed Kassig recounted receiving the first in December 2013 saying: \"Peter is at this moment our guest and we don't want to harm him\" and later, a message demanding 100 million euro in exchange for his release. The Kassigs had several subsequent email exchanges with their son's captors. In a video message to IS, they said their son \"grew to love Syria\" and had \"embraced Islam\" - a nod to his conversion while in captivity, and changing his name from Peter to Abdulrahman. They were able to receive a letter from their son in June 2014, even as they appealed to the White House and told the IS captors they were \"turning every stone\" to meet the ransom demands. However, the IS group released a video in November 2014 apparently showing Mr Kassig being executed. A FBI agent confirmed his death to the family, Mr Kassig said. His son had been a \"caring kid\" and particularly \"sensitive to the needs of others\", he told the court. He had served in the US Army and did a tour in the Middle East before becoming an aid worker after going to Turkey in 2013 and taking trips over the border to Syria, his father said. He founded the aid group Special Emergency Response and Assistance (Sera) because he \"realised there was a lethal time lag between when war breaks out and aid comes in,\" and it provided food and medical supplies to anyone in need. \"It didn't matter if it was a jihadi or a refugee,\" Mr Kassig said. Mr Elsheikh - on Wednesday wearing a white shirt and black mask - sat back in his chair and listened intently to the testimony, cocking his head slightly to look at the government's evidence, and making no eye contact with the witness. The trial continues, with as many as 50 witnesses expected.

Omer Kuzu, 26, testified on Monday that he met El Shafee Elsheikh in Syria on at least five occasions. He said while they did not talk much, Mr Elsheikh had an air of importance. Mr Elsheikh, 33, is accused of kidnapping and conspiracy and has denied all the charges. The Sudanese-born Londoner is alleged to have been part of an IS militant cell dubbed the Beatles by hostages because of their British accents. He is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US. The cell is said to have tortured and beheaded hostages in Syria, including several Western journalists and aid workers. Mr Kuzu, who spent four-and-a-half years as an IS member, testified at Mr Elsheikh's trial in Virginia as part of a plea deal with the US government. He said he had left his home in Dallas, Texas, at age 18 in October 2014 and was smuggled into Syria alone through the Turkish border. He told the court he worked at the telecommunications office in the city of Raqqa, then \"the capital of IS\", and did \"typical IT work\" to support the group's battlefield operations. Mr Kuzu was captured by Syrian forces in 2019 and handed over to the FBI. He pleaded guilty in Texas in September 2020 on a charge of conspiring to provide material support to IS. Taking the stand on Monday in a teal prison jumpsuit, he leaned forward into his microphone and spoke clearly, often saying \"yes sir\" in response to questions. Mr Kuzu said that while other guards wore traditional Afghan clothes, Mr Elsheikh wore a green military uniform and always carried a Glock pistol. Having a Glock was uncommon among the fighters, he said, calling it \"a symbol of Isis aristocracy\". He added that Mr Elsheikh was \"quiet, reserved, almost secretive\", which he believed indicated he didn't want to be a target of foreign intelligence agencies. Asked to identify Mr Elsheikh in the courtroom, he pointed at the defendant and described his clothing. Mr Elsheikh, who has sat through much of the trial in a disposable black mask, lowered his mask to be identified. Identification is a key part of the trial. The defence argues that Mr Elsheikh was a \"simple Isis fighter\" not one of the so-called Beatles, and therefore should not be held responsible for what that militant cell did. Under cross-examination, Mr Kuzu admitted that Mr Elsheikh had never explicitly told him about himself or what he did for IS. But he said \"his work was right in front of my eyes\". The Beatles have been described by witnesses as a cohesive unit. When Mr Kuzu met Mr Elsheikh and another alleged Beatle on one occasion, they appeared to be \"some sort of a duo or tag team\" to him. Former French IS hostage Didier Francois echoed similar sentiments when he took the stand on Monday. He told the court \"the atmosphere changed radically\" whenever the Beatles showed up. \"They were always together and always sadistic,\" the veteran war correspondent said, explaining they engaged in both physical and emotional abuse. \"Manicure or pedicure?\" they would ask, he claimed, before beating his hands and feet. Mr Francois was held alongside three other French journalists for 10 months before the men were all released together in April 2014. He described interacting with several other hostages during his captivity, including Americans James Foley and Peter Kassig. Both men converted to Islam while in captivity. Choking up, Mr Francois recalled the former asking him to tell his Catholic mother he had only done so because \"he loved his God and wanted to be able to worship him\".

The bill would criminalise performing an abortion in almost all cases, except where it could \"save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency\". Medical professionals convicted under the laws face fines of up to $100,000 (\u00a376,505) and 10 years in prison. It comes as the US Supreme Court weighs a case that could overturn abortion rights across the US later this year. Oklahoma's House of Representatives, in which Republicans hold a supermajority, voted to send the bill to the governor's office by 70 votes to 14. The state's Governor Kevin Stitt will be presented with the bill for his approval. The Republican has already committed to signing into law any legislation that restricts abortion rights. Republican Rep Jim Olsen, who authored the bill, said he was \"thrilled\" by its passage and said the legislation could see \"many lives of babies saved\". But pro-choice groups say the bill is a devastating blow for women, noting it comes after the state became a major destination for women from neighbouring Texas seeking abortions after the passage of extremely restrictive laws in the state last year. \"Nearly half of the patients Oklahoma providers are currently seeing are medical refugees from Texas,\" a coalition of pro-choice groups said. \"Now, Oklahomans could face a future where they would have no place left in their state to go to seek this basic health care.\" Tamya Cox-Toure, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, said in a statement the bill serves as an \"alarming reminder that the days of access to safe and legal abortion may be numbered, and we must continue to fight to guarantee all people have access to the essential health care they need, including abortion\". Republican dominated legislatures have been passing a series of restrictive abortion measures in recent years, designed to set up a showdown in the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. The court is due to rule by the end of June on a case involving a Republican-backed Mississippi law which could see conservative justices overturn the Roe v Wade decision that legalised abortion under federal law in 1973. The ruling could cut off abortion services for tens of millions of women and likely see similar laws bar abortion in nearly two dozen states. By Angelica Casas, BBC News, Texas The latest tactic in anti-abortion legislation is to target and punish providers. When Texas last year passed the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, some abortion providers I spoke to shut their services altogether, fearing reprimand. People seeking abortions were forced to find alternative options, like accessing abortion pills and travelling out of state. Nearly half of Texans who left the state went to Oklahoma. That may no longer be an option once this law goes into effect there later this year. \"Legislation like SB 612 on its face is very chilling to people's willingness to practise in states that are this hostile to providers,\" says Zachary Gingrich-Gaylord of Trust Women, one of four abortion clinics in Oklahoma. \"That's the point.\" Supporters of the law, like State Senator Nathan Dahm, have boasted that the measure is now the \"strongest pro-life legislation in the country\". And they point out the law does not penalise women but the providers. Trust Women has long depended on medical professionals from out of state to perform abortions because, they say, it's difficult to find local providers willing to go public about where they work. \"It makes it difficult to bring on even support staff in the clinic at a time that we're seeing an increased volume of patients,\" says Gingrich-Gaylord told me.

Maybe it was because the 9.2% he now owns is described as a passive stake, although those who know Musk do not expect it to stay that way for long. His first move was to launch a poll - asking whether people want an edit button, something long called for and perhaps something he personally needs. The new announcement that he will join Twitter's board comes as no surprise. In a tweet on Tuesday, Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal said \"through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board\".

Musk's 9.2%  stake in the social media company may sound small, but Dan Ives, from analyst firm Wedbush, describes it as \"eye-popping\" - equating to 73.5 million shares in the social network. Shares in the platform soared following Monday's revelation that the Tesla founder had become the largest shareholder in the company - meaning that stake has already grown in value and is now worth more than $3bn. Musk's shareholding is four times greater than that of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive in November. Mr Ives believes the South African entrepreneur now has his eyes \"laser set\" on Twitter, and his significant holding will see him push for an active role in the management of the company. \"We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,\" he said. Musk has something of a love-hate relationship with Twitter. He is a frequent tweeter, with more than 80 million followers - and no stranger to controversy in his interactions on the social media site. The platform seems to suit his impulsive personality - last year he famously asked if he should sell 10% of his stock in his electric car firm Tesla, to which Twitter users said 'yes'. It led to Musk selling around $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of shares in the firm in November. Months earlier he had offered to sign a cheque for $6bn if the World Food Programme (WFP) could explain how it would be used to solve hunger around the globe - after an assertion made by the head of the UN programme. But tweeting has also got him into trouble. A 2018 post about Tesla stock led to an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission which ended with an agreement requiring the firm's lawyers to pre-approve certain tweets. It is unclear if that actually happens. Interestingly, the Wall Street Journal reports that his Twitter share filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which under normal circumstances would include a line saying he doesn't intend to influence the company, came with a 'Not Applicable' mark. The timing of the deal has also raised questions and could once again put Musk at loggerheads with financial regulators. His investment in Twitter was filed on 14 March, but not announced until this week. US securities law requires disclosure within 10 days of acquiring 5% of a company. Musk uses Twitter not just as a barometer for how he runs his own companies, but also increasingly to take the temperature of the nation. Last month, after he had lodged his investment with the SEC - but before his shareholding became public knowledge - he asked users whether they believed that free speech was essential to a functioning democracy and whether Twitter adheres to this principle. Cornell University's assistant professor Alexandra Cirone thinks this is evidence he may use his new stake \"to try to influence Twitter practices\" and for a \"more active play in the social media eco-system\". But others see more immediate issues with his musings. Howard Fischer, partner at law firm Moses & Singer, told Reuters that, given he had already bought a stake in Twitter, these questions could be seen as a form of market manipulation. \"I do suspect the SEC is going to look long and hard into whether they can bring manipulation charges, along with the failure to file,\" he said. Mr Agrawal is clearly watching his every move. In response to his edit button poll, which currently has 2.6 million responses, he urged voters to do so \"carefully\". Allow Twitter content?

Jack Dorsey had always rejected the idea, and critics point out that it could allow people to fundamentally change the meaning of tweets after they have been shared. It would be a big change for Twitter to include an edit button, and Musk is clearly keen to be part of that conversation. For a while last month, it looked as if Musk was intent on building a new social media platform as a rival to Twitter - and there he does have precedent from another prolific and controversial tweeter. Donald Trump, who was banned from Twitter in January 2021 after the Capitol riots, announced last autumn that he was launching his own social network - dubbed Truth Social - to \"stand up to the tyranny of big tech\". But six weeks after its launch, there is a waiting list of 1.5 million who are unable to use it - with the platform branded a disaster by Joshua Tucker, director of NYU's Center for social media and politics. According to Reuters, two key executives quit after the troubled launch. For those with shares in Musk's many other businesses - Space X, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company - there will doubtless be a sigh of relief that he didn't go down the same route as Mr Trump. But there will also be concerns that he has yet another passion project to distract him from the serious business of running his established firms. Not to mention the issues that might now be raised about the Twitter deal by the SEC. Social media expert Casey Newton points out that it is not the first time a big tech firm has eyed Twitter. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once bought a four percent share of the company \"and essentially did nothing with it,\" he writes. But he goes on to say that Ballmer never tweeted like Musk did: \"gleefully, annoyingly, constantly\". And it seems most likely that it will be from this Twitter account that Musk will let the world know what he intends to do next.

She said Biden told them he felt terrible he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with them while he was in Texas and promised his scheduler would make an appointment for the family to meet with him in Washington. Biden told them he said a rosary for Trevor on his way to Texas, according to Paula Reed. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe was just very, very apologetic that he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. Reed added that Biden also told them he \u201a\u00c4\u00fathinks of Trevor every day and that he feels horrible that he hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to bring Trevor home yet. And he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to stop.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki had told reporters that a meeting could still happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00fa(W)e are working toward setting up a meeting with his family. The President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking forward to doing that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Psaki told reporters en route to Fort Worth aboard Air Force One. Trevor Reed has been detained in Russia since 2019. He was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the \u201a\u00c4\u00falife and health\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of Russian police officers after a night of drinking. He and his family have denied the charges and US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan called the trial \u201a\u00c4\u00fatheater of the absurd.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerned the invasion of Ukraine will worsen his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fate, along with that of Paul Whelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. The Reed family, who met with Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan last December, has said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been asking for the meeting with the President for months. Shortly after Psaki said a presidential meeting was in the works, Joey Reed told CNN the family has not had any new communication with the White House. Jon Franks, a spokesman for the Reed family, said Psaki\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statements were very welcome. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are grateful they seem to have reconsidered and await details. Just a reminder that the Reeds gratefully acknowledged their meeting with NSA Sullivan when it took place back in December. They look forward to gratefully acknowledging a meeting with their President,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Franks said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe want to talk to the President and say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the only man in the world who can bring him home and you can do it today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said Tuesday before the White House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Joey Reed said he heard Monday that the meeting during Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s trip on Tuesday would not happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we were told second hand was that there wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI know that every second is planned out for the President every day, but three minutes? Three or four minutes? I think he could spare that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trevor Reed has said in recent weeks that he is coughing up blood, and his family is concerned he has tuberculosis. Joey Reed said he spoke with his son as recently as Monday and asked Trevor if he wanted to pass along a message to Biden. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have anything to say to the President. I think that they have forgotten about me,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have not (forgotten about him). We love our son and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to fight to our dying day to bring him home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Brianna Keilar on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wednesday that they spoke with Trevor again Wednesday morning. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe called us again this morning. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been sounding horrible, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coughing constantly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd then we had even worse news this morning, he called and could barely talk. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s had some sort of accident and he believes he might have broken a rib.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed also said Trevor told them he would be sent to a hospital prison on Friday to be checked and while he believed Trevor has been honest about his health, expressed uncertainty that his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s injury was an accident. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt just seems to be getting worse and worse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Whelan, a former United States Marine, was sentenced to 16 years in prison on an espionage charge he vehemently denies. Whelan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family has said in recent days that the US should not forget about him and Reed as the US discusses Russian sanctions. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are watching the impact of sanctions, expected retaliation by the Russian Federation government, and making what contingency plans we can to support him,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Paul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s brother, David Whelan wrote in a statement released late last week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPaul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wrongful detention has always been about the Russian Federation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government extracting concessions from the US government.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the Russian Federation demands the concession of sanction removal, let Paul and Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s freedom be part of the price the Russian authorities pay in return,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 David Whelan added in the statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur family will be expressing this view to members of Congress, the State Department, and the White House.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. This week, the White House has turned some of its focus to Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention of American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner has been detained in Russia after customs officials detected cannabis oil in the athlete\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s luggage at an airport near Moscow, according to the Russian Federal Customs Service. According to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the administration is working on the process to get her out of Russia. The White House, so far, has publicly declined to discuss Griner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention or their potential efforts to secure her release.

The decision was made during a Board of Governors meeting held earlier in the day in Los Angeles. The meeting, initially scheduled for April 18, was expedited after Smith announced his resignation from the Academy last week. Smith issued a quick, concise statement on his ban from the Oscars for the next decade. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI accept and respect the Academy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the actor said in a statement to CNN.

The Academy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s letter added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year; however, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr. Smith exhibit on stage.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faDuring our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the letter went on to state. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFor this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short \u201a\u00c4\u00ee unprepared for the unprecedented.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Board of Governors said in a previous statement that they wanted the matter to be \u201a\u00c4\u00fahandled in a timely fashion.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Smith\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s resignation means that he is no longer part of the Academy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voting body, but it does not prevent the Oscar winner from being nominated in the future, a source with knowledge previously told CNN.\u00ac\u2020 Smith can also still be nominated despite being barred from attending the Oscars because \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe standards of conduct rules\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 at play in today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s action \u201a\u00c4\u00fado not apply to awards eligibility,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 a source close to the Academy with direct knowledge of the rules told CNN on Friday.

US President Joe Biden said the move targeted \"the main artery of Russia's economy\". Energy exports are a vital source of revenue for Russia but the move is also likely to impact Western consumers. Major brands have meanwhile continued to pull out of Russia, with McDonald's and Coca-Cola the latest to leave. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on energy. It is the world's third-biggest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia and the US. Before the measures were announced, Russia warned of \"catastrophic\" consequences for the global economy and said it might close its main gas pipeline to Germany. On the ground in Ukraine, civilians have been evacuated from two under-attack areas while the US has said up to 4,000 Russian troops may have been killed in the conflict. The conflict has already sent petrol prices to record highs in the US and the UK and experts warn they could go even higher. However, Venezuela could increase its oil production to help replace Russian oil. Reinaldo Quintero, president of the association that represents Venezuelan oil companies told the BBC that the country could potentially raise its production levels by 400,000 barrels a day. \"I think we can reach 1.2 million barrels per day with the infrastructure we have right now at this moment. So that will make us able to supply the need, some of the need, to the North American market,\" he said. President Biden's announcement followed pressure from both sides of the US political divide to do more to target the Russian economy. \"We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,\" he said. \"That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to [President Vladimir] Putin.\" Mr Biden admitted the move was \"not without cost at home,\" adding the decision was taken \"in close consultation\" with allies. In a similar move, the UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, accepted that the move would not hit Russia immediately but added \"what it will do is add to the pressure we're already seeing on Russia and don't forget that the economic impact of the sanctions that the UK has led has been extreme\". About 8% of US oil and refined product imports come from Russia, while Russia makes up about 6% of the UK's oil imports. By contrast, the EU is much more reliant on Russian energy, so the bloc's response stopped short of a ban. The European Commission said it would switch to alternative supplies and expand clean energy faster to fill the shortfall, with the aim of making Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels \"well before 2030\". This video can not be played Watch: Five times Russians have stood up for Ukraine \"We're not standing here to say this is going to be in any way easy,\" said the European Commission's Vice-President Frans Timmermans. \"But I am also deeply convinced that even if it's not easy, even if it's very hard, it's something we need to do, because now it's also intimately linked to our security.\" Russia later announced plans to ban the exports of certain commodities and raw materials. The details are still to be worked out, but Russia is a major exporter of grain and metals. Even countries with low Russian energy imports are set to feel the impact as the measures are likely to boost already high wholesale prices. Inflation is soaring in the US, EU and the UK, adding to the pressure on households. The move adds to a long list of economic sanctions imposed against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine - the central bank has had its assets frozen, some Russian banks have been cut off from global payment networks and Germany suspended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have transported more gas from Russia to Germany. But energy sales have continued to provide a source of cash despite the other financial restrictions.

After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives. Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have \"enormous consequences\". And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas. In a statement, he said Europe had \"deliberately exempted\" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured \"any other way\" at the moment. Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. \"Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,\" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine. Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are \"moving very, very fast\" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are \"now very much on the table\". He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%. Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be \"diligent and not overnight\", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy. An immediate change would \"basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,\" he said, adding: \"It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself.\" Mr Johnson also announced a further \u00a3175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials. Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday. During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was \"processing thousands\" and would be \"very generous\" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks. The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry. Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict. But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a \"complete mess\" and the government must establish a \"simple route to sanctuary\", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was \"not doing anywhere near enough\" to help refugees. More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Home Office is in a \"complete mess\" over how Ukrainians can get to the UK Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals. In recent days, the government has announced asset freezes and travel bans on a number of oligarchs - but has faced accusations of being too slow to sanction those with links to President Putin. The bill will set up a new register that will mean foreign owners of UK property must declare and verify their identities with Companies House. MPs are expected to vote through all stages of the bill in a single sitting. Labour said it would support the legislation, but wanted the proposed timeframe for property owners to register to be cut from six months to 28 days.

The vehicle, known as the Space Launch System (SLS), was taken to Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to conduct a dummy countdown. If that goes well, the rocket will be declared ready for a mission in which it will send an uncrewed test capsule around the Moon. This could happen in the next couple of months. Ultimately, it's hoped astronauts would climb aboard later SLS rockets to return to the Moon's surface sometime in the second half of this decade. These missions are part of what Nasa calls its Artemis programme. Watching the roll-out, agency administrator Bill Nelson said we were entering a golden era of human space exploration. \"The Artemis generation is preparing to reach new frontiers,\" he told the spectator crowds gathered at Kennedy. \"This generation will return astronauts to the Moon and this time, we will land the first woman and the first person of colour on the surface, to conduct ground-breaking science. \"Nasa's Artemis programme will pave the way for humanity's giant leap (to) future missions to Mars.\" SLS is a colossus. A touch under 100m in height, it was designed to be more powerful than the Apollo Saturn vehicles of the late 1960s and early 1970s. It will have the thrust to not only send astronauts far beyond Earth but additionally so much equipment and cargo that those crews could stay away for extended periods. Thursday's rollout from Kennedy's Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the rocket's debut in the sense that it's the very first time everyone has got to see all its different elements fully stacked together. The SLS move from the VAB began 17:47 local Florida time. The rocket came out attached to a support gantry known as the Mobile Launcher. This structure, which is itself 120m high and weighs 5,000 tonnes, was sitting atop the same mammoth tractor that used to move the Saturn Vs back in the day, and later the space shuttles. The Crawler Transporter goes very slowly, with a cruising speed of just over 1km/h (under 1mph). And after engineers had stopped and started the tractor for various checks, it was 04:15 on Friday morning by the time the procession had reached Pad 39B. A total journey distance of 6.75km. SLS will now be prepared for a \"wet dress rehearsal\", likely to occur on 3 April. This will see the rocket loaded with propellants and taken through a practice countdown all the way to a mere 9.4 seconds from the moment of lift-off. The \"scrub\" point is just before they would normally light the four big shuttle-era engines under the rocket. Assuming everything proceeds to the satisfaction of the engineers, Nasa will then be able to set a flight date. The end of May remains a possibility, but more likely it will be June or July. This mission, dubbed Artemis-1, will propel the rocket's Orion crew capsule on a 26-day journey that includes an expanded orbit around the Moon. There will be no-one in the capsule for the test flight. This should happen on a second mission in a couple of years' time. While Nasa is developing the SLS, the American rocket entrepreneur Elon Musk is preparing an even larger vehicle at his R&D facility in Texas. He calls his giant rocket the Starship. Like SLS it has yet to have a maiden flight. Unlike SLS, Starship has been designed to be totally reusable and ought therefore to be considerably cheaper to operate. A recent assessment from the Office of Inspector General, which audits Nasa programmes, found that the first four SLS missions would each cost more than $4bn to execute - a sum of money that was described as \"unsustainable\".\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The US Commerce Department has said the planes are in contravention of US sanctions on Russia. Providing service to these aircraft anywhere in the world - including inside Russia - may lead to heavy fines and potential jail time, it says. The list includes aircraft operated by Russian airlines, including Aeroflot. While most are Boeing aircraft, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovich - the current owner of Chelsea football club - is also included. The Russian was among seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government earlier this month in response to the Ukraine war. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. In a statement, the department said any refuelling, maintenance or repair work of any of the listed aircraft - as well as the provision of spare parts - violates US export controls. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was in response to \"Russia's brutal war of choice against Ukraine\". She added: \"We are publishing this list to put the world on notice - we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.\" The department said violators face \"substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions\". The regulations apply to any aircraft which has more than 25% US-origin content that was re-exported to Russia after new controls came into effect on 24 February, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. \"By preventing these aircraft from receiving any service, for example, including from abroad, international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded,\" the statement added. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said the US government hoped the move highlighted Russia's increasing isolation from the global economy. \"Our actions aren't idle words or dead letters on the page,\" he said. \"They have real teeth and as Putin's vicious war continues, they will continue to bite harder on the Russian and Belarusian economies\". The US, Canada and European allies have already banned Russian aircraft from operating in their airspace, forcing Russian airlines to largely abandon their international routes.

US Marshals found and arrested 28-year-old Jacob Greer in Spanaway, Washington, on Monday. He had been on the run since 2016, authorities said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe arrest of Jacob Greer after six years is a testament to the tenacity of Deputy US Marshals and our investigative partners,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ted Kamatchus, US Marshal for the Southern District of Iowa, said in the Tuesday statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faEven though the case went cold, they would not quit,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kamatchus said. Greer is currently at the Federal Detention Center in Seattle and will be transported to Des Moines to stand trial, accoring to the statement. He will be assigned counsel when he returns to Iowa, the Iowa public defender\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office said. Greer was initially arrested in April 2016 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on charges of alleged receipt and possession of child pornography. He was released on bond the next day under pretrial supervision with an ankle monitor. He was living with his grandmother in Des Moines at the time. On May 31, 2016, Greer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s probation officer was alerted that Greer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ankle monitor had been removed, resulting in a multiagency search effort, the US Marshals statement said. Authorities found Greer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s car with a suicide note inside, but searchers never found his body and a federal arrest warrant for Greer was issued. Investigators later discovered another vehicle associated with Greer at a campground in Flathead, Montana, which he had purchased with a $1,000 loan from a friend, the statement said. The US Marshals Service said Greer was last seen at a Walmart in Kalispell, Montana, in June 2016, wearing a camouflage hat. Greer had allegedly fled Iowa with money, a bow, arrows and a backpack full of survival gear and \u201a\u00c4\u00fahad plans to live off the land in remote areas of the upper western states or southern Canada, hiding out in abandoned cabins,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said.

Morad Tahbaz, 66, who also has Iranian citizenship, has been confined to a hotel, the Foreign Office has said. His sister Taraneh told the BBC his family was \"absolutely distraught\" and feared he would be forgotten about. The Foreign Office says it is continuing to lobby Iran at the highest levels for Mr Tahbaz to be released. Hopes had been raised that Mr Tahbaz would be freed when Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released and flew back to the UK on Thursday, but he was returned to Evin prison on Friday. The Foreign Office said it had been informed by the Iranians this move was in order for Mr Tahbaz to have an electronic ankle bracelet fitted. On Sunday, the Foreign Office said he had been moved to a hotel in Tehran. Appearing alongside Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe at a news conference on Monday, Mr Tahbaz's daughter, Roxanne, said the family had been led to believe her father would be released with the other dual nationals. \"From the outset, we were always assured by the [UK government] that my father would be included in any deal that was made to release all of the hostages. \"So we're truly devastated, knowing now that this was not the case.\" Roxanne Tahbaz said the family \"just want them [the UK government] to do whatever they have to do\" to bring her father and mother, who is also subject to a travel ban inside Iran, back home. Speaking on the Today programme earlier, Taraneh Tahbaz said Mr Tahbaz had gone on hunger strike. \"He continues to be used as a pawn on a chessboard and it's very distressing,\" she said. \" We're agonised and we're absolutely distraught and we don't know what the next moves are.\" Mr Tahbaz was doing conservation work when he was held in Iran in January 2018. He and seven other conservationists were accused of collecting classified information about Iran's strategic areas under the pretext of carrying out environmental and scientific projects. The conservationists - members of Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation - had been using cameras to track endangered species including the Asiatic cheetah and Persian leopard, according to Amnesty International. All eight denied the charges and Amnesty International said there was evidence that they had been subjected to torture in order to extract forced \"confessions\". He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with his colleagues on vague charges of spying for the US and undermining Iran's security. Last year, UN human rights experts warned that Mr Tahbaz, who has cancer and has twice had Covid, had been denied access to proper treatment in prison despite his health condition deteriorating.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The shooting took place Monday on the grounds of East High School, though not within the school building. Gunshots were fired by multiple shooters from multiple vehicles, police said.

In their appeal filed Monday, Trump and his children Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. argued that if New York Attorney General Letitia James wants their testimony, she should bring them before a state grand jury investigating the Trump Organization, where witnesses receive transactional immunity for their testimony in New York. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys wrote that if the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office is allowed to depose their clients, the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s constitutional and statutory protections can easily be \u201a\u00c4\u00faeviscerated if the same agency involved in the criminal investigation simply opens up a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2civil\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 investigation into the very same matters.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe question is whether the (Office of the Attorney General) can use the office subpoenas to avoid the grand jury process and compel testimony from those whom it does not wish to grant immunity,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the appeal states. A state judge ruled against the Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 request in February, saying they could invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refuse to answer questions, which Eric Trump did during his 2020 deposition. Attorneys for the Trump family argued that a jury could draw an \u201a\u00c4\u00faadverse inference\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if the Trumps opted not to answer questions in depositions. New York Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron had ordered the Trumps to sit for depositions by March 10, but the former President and his children reached a deal to delay those appearances until after an appeal is decided. James said in court filings in January that her office\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s civil investigation had uncovered significant evidence that the Trump Organization used \u201a\u00c4\u00fafraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage and tax deductions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and that financial statements had numerous \u201a\u00c4\u00famisleading statements and omissions.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 A parallel criminal investigation conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office has been looking into the former President and his business and whether they misled lenders, insurers and others by providing false or misleading financial statements about property values. But the investigation has reached an impasse, and two top attorneys resigned earlier this month after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he was not prepared to authorize an indictment against the former President, CNN previously reported. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys wrote that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faundisputed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that the criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office targets the valuations and appraisals of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s properties in financial statements to taxing authorities and financial institutions, just as the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigation does. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys cited a filing from the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office in January where it writes that \u201a\u00c4\u00facoordination between parallel civil and criminal proceedings is standard procedure.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In their appeal, the Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys also ask the appellate court to reverse Engoron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision and allow there to be a hearing on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fascope and extent of coordination\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 between the Manhattan district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office and the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys want to ask whether two attorneys from James\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 office are providing information or reporting back to the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Wake Forest University Medical School is standing by a student who suggested she intentionally harmed one of her patients for disagreeing with her about transgender ideology. The student, fourth-year Kychelle Del Rosario, came under fire after appearing to boast about the incident on Twitter in late March. The university responded with a brief suspension but announced no further consequences in its latest statement. Del Rosario tweeted: \"I had a patient I was doing a blood draw on see my pronoun pin and loudly laugh to the staff \u2018She/Her? Well of course it is! What other pronouns even are there?\u2019 I missed his vein so he had to get stuck twice.\" The university publicly responded to the incident in a statement on Wednesday, saying Del Rosario's tweet was not an accurate recounting of the incident. \"Our documentation verifies that after the student physician was unsuccessful in obtaining the blood draw, the student appropriately deferred a second attempt to one of our certified professionals. The student did not attempt to draw blood again,\" the school wrote. ETHICS PROFESSOR SLAMS MEDICAL STUDENT WHO IMPLIED SHE STUCK A PATIENT FOR MOCKING HER PRONOUN PIN The university's statement included a lengthy apology letter from Del Rosario, in which she claims she never intended to harm the individual, blaming the missed vein on inexperience. \"For the event mentioned in the tweet, I was performing a blood draw on a patient and during our conversation they had shown dismay at my pronoun pin,\" Del Rosario wrote, according to the university newspaper. \"I calmly shared my thoughts about pronouns and did not escalate the situation further. When I was doing the blood draw, I missed the first time due to my inexperience as a student, and per our policy, my supervisor performed the successful blood draw the second time. During this encounter, I never intended to harm the patient.\" \"I am truly sorry for poorly representing our school and our health system. I will reflect on responsible social media use as a professional and my duty to care for all my patients, regardless of any differences of belief,\" she concluded. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Del Rosario's actions led to heavy criticism on social media, many of her fellow Wake Forest students jumped to defend her. One op-ed published in the school's newspaper was titled \"Criticism of Wake Forest medical student is excessive.\" \"The crux of the issue at hand is not the conduct of Del Rosario, but the bigotry expressed by her patient,\" claimed the author, opinions editor and sophomore Sophie Guymon. \"It is appalling that the vast majority of the media coverage surrounding Del Rosario\u2019s tweet is critiquing her lack of professionalism rather than her patient\u2019s display of bigotry.\" Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

The trip was put together by Axiom Space, a private startup that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s booking rides with SpaceX and coordinating flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. What to know about Axiom Space, the company behind the first all-private mission to the ISS The passengers on this trip \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which includes former NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegr\u221a\u2260a, who will command the mission as an Axiom employee, and three paying customers \u201a\u00c4\u00ee are slated to take off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday at 11:17 am ET. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll ride inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, the same capsule that SpaceX has used to carry NASA astronauts to the ISS already. The capsule rides to orbit on top of one of SpaceX\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 230-foot-tall Falcon 9 rockets. This mission, called AX-1, will mark the first time in history that private citizens, or otherwise non-professional astronauts, will launch to the ISS from US soil. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the first of what Axiom, the company that organized and brokered this mission with SpaceX, hopes will be many similar flights for anyone who can afford it. The AX-1 mission is also only the second space tourism flight for SpaceX, following up the September 2021 launch of four private citizens on a three-day, freeflying trip through orbit that traveled even higher than the ISS. During their eight-day stay on the space station, the AX-1 crew will conduct some science experiments, break bread with the professional astronauts already on board the football-field sized space station, and enjoy sweeping views of our home planet whisking by down below. Lopez-Alegr\u221a\u2260a, 63, took of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA. He left the space agency in 2012, and he joined Axiom a few years later with the aim of going back to space \u201a\u00c4\u00ee but as a private astronaut rather than an official member of the corps. Axiom serves as an intermediary between paying customers who want to take a multimillion-dollar thrill ride to space, booking flights with SpaceX, handling negotiations with NASA, and taking over the training for the would-be space travelers. Axiom hopes to make these flights a regular occurrence, as NASA agreed a few years ago to open up the ISS to space tourism and other commercial ventures. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not clear how much these trips cost the customer. Though previously disclosed prices indicated a trip to the ISS is $55 million per seat, Axiom declined to confirm that figure this week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAxiom Space does not disclose financial terms,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Axiom spokesperson Bettina Inclan told CNN Buisness via email.) There are three paying customers on this flight. They are all wealthy white men, continuing a trend plaguing the commercial spaceflight sector and its inaccessibility to more diverse swaths of the population. The vast majority of people who have thus far been able to afford to pay their way to space \u201a\u00c4\u00ee whether on SpaceX flights or suborbital missions like those offered by Blue Origin \u201a\u00c4\u00ee have been white businessmen. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s indicative of just how far the reality is from the promised far-off space dream that comes from entrepreneurs who claim that space is \u201a\u00c4\u00fafor everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and commercializing space will \u201a\u00c4\u00fademocratize it\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 amid ballooning income inequality. With price points this exuberant, space will remain commercially accessible only to the elite few for the foreseeable future. Though the aim is to eventually drastically reduce the cost of getting to space, hopefully making ticket prices affordable for more people, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not clear how or when that will happen. Larry Connor, 72, is a real estate tycoon from Dayton, Ohio. He founded The Connor Group, which has developments in 16 markets across the country and has more than $3.5 billion in assets, according to the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s website. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s an avid adventurer, having raced cars and climbed mountains. He also has experience as a private pilot and has participated in aerobatic competitions, and he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be the designated pilot for this mission. (It should be noted SpaceX\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Crew Dragon is fully autonomous, though spaceflight pilots train to be prepared to take over is something goes awry.) \u201a\u00c4\u00faMy journey really started seven or eight years ago. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve always been interested in space, and I started thinking about after I read about an American who went to Russia and went on the Soyuz [spacecraft],\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said in an interview with the Dayton Society of Natural History last year, after his plans to fly on AX-1 were revealed. Connor was likely referring to one of the US citizens who booked a flight to the ISS through Space Adventures, a company that has booked seats aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft for tourists going back to the early 2000s. Those flight have always been coordinated with the Russian space agency and included official Russian astronauts. The AX-1 mission will be the first to include a crew made up entirely of private astronauts. Connor said he decided to book the mission for \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe challenge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are going to truly train to the professional astronaut standards,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.

Of the AX-1 mission, Pathy told CTV News: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is a lot of money. I feel very fortunate to be able to afford this kind of trip. Obviously not many people can. But at the same time I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to, fortunately, choose between doing something like this or being active philanthropically.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He added that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fabeen a dream since I was a little kid and watched Captain Kirk bouncing around the universe in the Enterprise\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to go to space. Eytan Stibbe, 64, is an Israeli businessman. According to his Axiom bio, Stibbe, a former fighter pilot in the Israeli Air Force, founded Vital Capital a decade ago. Its website states the company invests in companies involved in sectors like food and healthcare across developing areas, notably across Africa, for \u201a\u00c4\u00fahigh-return opportunities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Axiom says that Stibbe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s journey is happening \u201a\u00c4\u00fain collaboration\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the Ramon Foundation, a space education non-profit named for Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Stibbe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Axiom bio also says he and Ramon shared a \u201a\u00c4\u00faclose\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 friendship. Stibbe will be only the second Israeli to go to space. He announced his decision to join the AX-1 crew at \u201a\u00c4\u00e3a ceremony at the Israeli President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Residence in 2020, and it was met with criticism from Israeli press, which pointed to alleged dealings in Stibbe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s past, particularly related to accusations of trafficking military equipment \u201a\u00c4\u00e3during his time with LR Group, an investment and development group and which he left in 2011, according to a representative for Stibbe. Specifically, reports allege that Stibbe was involved in the sale of military aircraft in Angola, which was embroiled in a brutal civil war from the 1970s through 2002. The allegations trace back to reporting from Israeli news site Haaretz. In a television interview from 2012, which was conducted in Hebrew and translated by Israeli news outlets and CNN Business, Stibbe also appeared to confirm his involvement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe helped Angola end the war by bringing them interceptor aircraft, two Su-27 fighter planes, from Uzbekistan,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faTheir presence in the country stopped the flights that were supplying weapons, food and ammunition and the export of illegal diamonds from Angola. After one, or one and a half years, the war ended.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 A statement shared with CNN Business on behalf of Stibbe states that, \u201a\u00c4\u00faLR Group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s business in Angola dealt almost exclusively with agricultural infrastructure, vocational training, water, airports, and telecommunications.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 It adds that LR Group \u201a\u00c4\u00fareceived a request from the [US-backed Angolan] government to help upgrade its airspace infrastructure to ICAO international standards,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and that the aircraft sales were made \u201a\u00c4\u00fawith export licenses and were completely legal.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn addition, the aircraft and air-control radars were used for deterrence purposes only,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement reads. LR Group responded in a statement to CNN Business, saying \u201a\u00c4\u00faLR Group has been involved in the fields of health, telecommunications, food, agriculture, renewable energy and water, with the aim of developing the independence and economic and social well-being of local populations around the world.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faDuring the time when Stibbe was a partner in the company, he was serving as the partner responsible for the operation and financing of the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s business activity in Angola,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement reads. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAfter he separated from the company, he bought in 2012 the activity in Angola, and continued operating there.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 LR Group is currently involved in a legal dispute pertaining to allegations against Stibbe dating to when he was a partner at the company. Stibbe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s representatives declined to comment on the legal battle. As for his decision to go to space, Stibbe said \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a kid on dark nights I used to watch the stars and wait patiently to see a shooting star, and I asked myself, What is there beyond what the eyes see?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said in comments translated by i24NEWS.

Amir Locke was at his cousin's apartment on 2 February when a Swat team entered the home. Prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to charge officer Mark Hanneman, who fired the fatal shot. They also said they did not have enough evidence to prove criminal wrongdoing by any of the other officers involved. Mr Locke was sleeping in a couch in his cousin's apartment when a nine-member Swat team entered the home. In bodycam footage released by the police after the incident, he is under a blanket on the couch holding a gun - for which he had a permit - in his hand. He was shot three times by Mr Hanneman. His family has said they believe he was startled and reached for the weapon in self-defence. A judge had approved a warrant for the raid, which was conducted as part of an investigation into a fatal shooting in the neighbouring city of St Paul. Mr Locke was not a suspect in the killing or named in the warrant, and his death prompted outrage and protests in Minneapolis. On Wednesday, County Attorney Michael Freeman and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement that there was \"insufficient admissible evidence to file criminal charges in this case\". The circumstances in the case \"are such that an objectively reasonable officer in Officer Hanneman's position would have perceived an immediate threat of death or great bodily harm\" the statement said, adding that \"an objectively reasonable officer would not delay in using deadly force\". The statement also said that Mr Locke, an aspiring musician, was a victim and that his life mattered. \"He should be alive today, and his death is a tragedy\". Mr Locke's mother Karen Wells said in a news conference following the announcement that she was \"disgusted with Minneapolis, Minnesota\". Her son's death drew comparisons to the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot and killed in her Louisville, Kentucky home by US police in March 2020 during another no-knock raid, which allows police to access without announcing their presence before entering. Ms Wells vowed to \"continue the fight for the no-knock warrant bans in honour of his name [and] for Breonna Taylor\". \"This cannot happen to anybody else,\" she said. As of Friday, Minneapolis police will no longer be allowed to apply for or execute no-knock warrants or respond to such requests from other police forces, barring certain '\"exigent\" circumstances, the mayor's office said this week. Under the new policy, police must repeatedly knock and announce their presence and purpose prior to entry.

The country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first woman justice, nominated by President Ronald Reagan, made deft use of the forum to introduce herself to the nation and eventually to win confirmation by a 99-0 vote. Since then, audiences have seen other historic moments, dramatic flashpoints and instances of levity. As the Senate begins its hearings for President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who would be the first Black woman justice, here are 10 of the many episodes that have stood out over the past four decades. She emphasized at the outset her experience as a state court judge in Arizona and her devotion to family. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBy way of preamble,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said as she began introducing her family, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI would note that \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I have performed some marriage ceremonies in my capacity as judge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She then read from the form she used describing marriage as \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe foundation of the family, mankind\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s basic unit of society, the hope of the world and strength of the country.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Connor was a former state senator and experienced politician who nimbly handled queries about the law and her life. The Senate confirmed her without any dissent. This nominee of Reagan with a deeply conservative record faced a Democratic Senate, and in particular, Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy set much of the tone when he dramatically claimed of the then-President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s plan to elevate the US appellate court judge: \u201a\u00c4\u00faRobert Bork\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, Blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 doors in midnight raids.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 At the hearings, Bork\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s right-wing ideology, rather than his intelligence and experience, remained the focus. When asked why he wanted to be a justice, he memorably stressed the \u201a\u00c4\u00faintellectual feast\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of it all: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have spent my life in the intellectual pursuits in the law. And since I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been a judge, I particularly like the courtroom. I like the courtroom as an advocate and I like the courtroom as a judge. \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 (T)hat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s of course the Court that has the most interesting cases and issues, and I think it would be an intellectual feast just to be there and to read the briefs and discuss things with counsel and discuss things with my colleagues.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bork was defeated 58-42. He was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to succeed the first Black justice, Thurgood Marshall, who was retiring. Thomas, also African American, underwent two sets of hearings, the first devoted to his substantive record, the second following the sexual harassment accusations of law professor Anita Hill, a former Thomas employee. He categorically denied the charges, declaring to the committee, chaired by then-Sen. Joe Biden, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is a circus. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a national disgrace. And from my standpoint as a Black American, as far as I am concerned, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate confirmed him 52-48, which at that point was the closest Supreme Court confirmation vote in more than a century. President George W. Bush nominated him to be chief justice upon the death of William Rehnquist, and Roberts\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 balls-and-strikes metaphor continues to be evoked by judicial candidates today: \u201a\u00c4\u00faJudges are like umpires,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Roberts told senators. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUmpires don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t make the rules, they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Roberts was confirmed for chief justice by a 78-22 vote. Biden remained an active Senate Judiciary Committee questioner even after he passed on the committee chairmanship, and he brought in a prop for an exchange with Alito. The then-senator was exploring the nominee\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s connection to a Princeton alumni group reputed to oppose the admission of women and minorities. Biden first referred to Alito\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Italian-American background and his own Irish Catholic roots. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI read your opening statement again, where you said that, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2A generation earlier I think that somebody from my background probably would not have felt fully comfortable at a college like Princeton.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s how I felt,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Biden, who went to the University of Delaware for college. Biden then produced a Princeton cap and put it on. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI can wear this hat proudly today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, because the university improved its record of women and minority admissions. Alito told senators he could not recall participating in the controversial group. The Senate confirmed him 58-42. The child of Puerto Rican parents was nominated by President Barack Obama as the first Hispanic justice. She drew some controversy for a remark she often made as she spoke to women\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legal groups, that \u201a\u00c4\u00faI would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t lived that life.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Some Republicans contended the comment was racist and it began to take on a life of its own. At her hearings, Sotomayor said she wanted to make clear that she was simply trying to inspire Latinas to believe that their life experiences would enrich the legal system. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI want to state upfront and unequivocally and without doubt, I do not believe any ethnic, racial, or gender group has an advantage in sound judging.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She was confirmed 68-31. Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second nominee produced one of the lighter memorable exchanges as she was questioned by Sen. Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina Republican began asking her about a failed al Qaeda bomb plot on Christmas Day in 2009. Kagan was wary about where he was heading with his questioning about the man apprehended. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Graham said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just asked you where you were on Christmas.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She rejoined, \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou know, like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Appreciating the levity, Graham said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faGreat answer.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate approved Kagan 63-37. President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first choice for the high court had a record from more than a decade as a US appellate court judge based in Denver, but one case was particularly targeted. It involved a trucker whose rig had broken down in sub-zero temperatures and who, against company rules, unhitched it and drove away to warm up awhile. When the case came before him, Gorsuch interpreted federal law to say the trucker who was fired was not covered by the usual statutory labor protections. Then-Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, drilled down on the case, identifying with the trucker and describing his plight as \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsurd.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Gorsuch said his decision was limited by his interpretation of the law at issue. When pressed by Franken about what he would have done if he had been a trucker, the judge said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faOh, Senator, I do not know what I would have done if I were in his shoes, and I do not blame him at all for a moment for doing what he did. I empathize with him entirely.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate confirmed Gorsuch 54-45. This Trump nominee, like Thomas, had two sets of hearings, the second prompted by a sexual assault claim raised by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, dating to their teenage years living in the Washington, DC, suburbs. Kavanaugh categorically denied the claim and told the committee, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades. This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country. And as we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around. I am an optimistic guy, I always try to be on the sunrise side of the mountain, to be optimistic about the day that is coming, but today I have to say that I fear for the future.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate confirmed him 50-48. Graham chaired the Judiciary Committee hearings for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s third nominee and declared at the outset, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is the first time in American history that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve nominated a woman who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Barrett, a former Notre Dame law professor, had been vocal regarding her Catholic faith and opposition to abortion rights. In her own testimony, Barrett said she had \u201a\u00c4\u00fano agenda\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 regarding the reversal of the Supreme Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s abortion rights precedent dating to the 1973 Roe v. Wade. Barrett testified without notes and, at the urging of Sen. John Cornyn, held up the blank notepad that was on the desk before her. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s impressive,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Texas Republican said. The Senate confirmed her 52-48.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Biden should seize the moment\n    Article Content: Editor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Note: Nick Dowling is chairman of IDS International, which provides training, cyber, information warfare and technical services to national security customers. He was director of European affairs in the Clinton White House, working to help implement the Dayton Accords. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. Dressed in his green military T-shirt, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ended his live-streamed speech to Congress on Wednesday with a direct appeal to President Joe Biden: \u201a\u00c4\u00faToday it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not enough to be the leader of the nation \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 It was not a throwaway line \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it was a deliberate plea that Biden should take seriously. A ceasefire or peace deal in the coming weeks could potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives and untold injuries and suffering. It would reduce the dangerous risk of further escalation and the potential of open conflict between NATO and Russia. And it might be the best option to preserve Ukrainian sovereignty and independence. Russia and Ukraine have been talking, but negotiations, which are still in the early stages, would benefit from a leader like Biden facilitating the process. Having worked as the director for European affairs at the National Security Council in the Clinton White House, I saw firsthand how essential presidential leadership can be in the cause of peace. We saw this in Bosnia when early UN peace negotiations efforts failed but US-led negotiations succeeded in 1995 with the Dayton Accords. The one leader who can bring Americans together US envoy Richard Holbrooke\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s success in brokering the deal was only possible because of President Bill Clinton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s personal and direct backing. We saw this again in Northern Ireland in 1998 when Clinton and US mediator George Mitchell helped broker the Good Friday Agreement ending decades of civil war. Sometimes more direct presidential involvement is essential, as it was when Jimmy Carter brokered the Camp David Accords that brought peace to Israel and Egypt or when President Teddy Roosevelt played a key role in mediating the Treaty of Portsmouth, which ended the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. Presidential leadership is essential for three reasons. First, negotiations are extraordinarily difficult because the cause of peace itself often conflicts with deeply felt principles of identity or justice. How do you convince the leader of one country to sit down and negotiate with another who has laid waste to the land and lives of his or her people? These challenges require incredibly strong third-party leadership to focus on the shared goals of peace and stability moving forward. Biden must tread carefully amid mounting criticism on Ukraine Second, the United States brings tremendous leverage and power to the negotiating table across the political, economic and military spectrum. American leadership is often at the vanguard of international support and can bring the collective power and influence of much of the world on board. Third, the American study and practice of peace negotiations give it credibility and expertise, having previously led warring parties to peace \u201a\u00c4\u00ec even when one was hostile to the United States. As Egypt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s President Anwar Sadat once said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Russians can give you arms but only the United States can give you a solution.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sadat cited American leadership, even though he knew America was the close ally of his enemy Israel. Of course, Russia, as America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s historic enemy, is a different beast, and the dynamics surrounding the war in Ukraine make peace talks particularly difficult. Vladimir Putin, who shows no signs of cowing to the West, has suggested a willingness to use nuclear weapons, and any escalation involving the NATO countries could potentially kick off a world war. Can the US be a legitimate peacemaker in Putin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s eyes? Yes, given the reasons above, although Biden would have to walk a tightrope given that Putin will likely interact with the US as a negotiating counterpart rather than as a third-party mediator. But the US can still actively engage with both sides to find peace. China may be able to play a useful role at the negotiating table by serving as a constructive counterbalance to perceptions of US bias. In recent days, China has subtly distanced itself from Russia, and Xi Jinping told Biden the events in Ukraine were in no one\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interest during their two-hour call Friday. But China has not openly condemned Russia, and it remains unclear just what role, if any, Xi is willing to play in brokering peace. In any case, Biden should push for a peace deal, especially now that the Russian invasion has largely stalled. Nobody signs a peace deal when they think they will be better off continuing to fight. World leaders make the difficult decision to lay down arms when their interests are better served by compromise. Those conditions are in place right now. Putin has backed himself into a corner, and he needs a way out of the trap he has set for himself. His military campaign is going far worse than anticipated, both on the ground and in terms of global condemnation. The only way to guarantee nuclear weapons are never used Putin significantly underestimated the Ukrainians\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 will to fight, while the US and its allies have announced punishing sanctions on Russia. With the Russian offensive suffering major losses, Putin has no clear military option but to resort to bombarding Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s cities, terrorizing its people and turning the country into an unlivable hell. This may serve Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s short-term strategic objectives, but would incur a far higher political and economic cost in the long run for both Putin and his entire country. On the Ukrainian side, high morale and heroic resistance may enable Ukraine to resist Russian occupation, but it will not be enough to end the war any time soon. Instead, they will continue to suffer as Putin uses more and more inhumane tactics to inflict punishment. For Ukrainians, a decision to fight to the end may be akin to a decision to watch the destruction of their nation in a resolute attempt to save it. If Ukraine wants to avoid the devastation of its cities and alleviate widespread suffering, it will have to give Putin at least some face-saving off-ramp if it wants even a chance of striking peace. Zelensky has already acknowledged it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unlikely Ukraine will join NATO anytime soon \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a move Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called a \u201a\u00c4\u00fareflection of reality.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 There are already ongoing talks of establishing a peace plan that could give both sides a way to declare victory. But peace deals don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always lead to an immediate resolution \u201a\u00c4\u00ec oftentimes, they simply establish a process for continuing to work through contentious issues. Sign up for CNN Opinion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Biden should be thinking about what potential agreements can be struck in the near-term, and what must be punted down the road for more extended talks. His road map to peace should involve three steps: 1) engage Ukraine and Russia separately to help identify interests and establish an agreed upon process; 2) identify interim steps to build confidence and momentum such as a ceasefire, pullback of forces or cooperative humanitarian measures; 3) when the time is right, push more intense negotiations on a peace framework that will start to bring the negotiators face-to-face for long negotiating sessions.

Congress has been embroiled in a months-long stalemate over new funding to fight the pandemic, with House Democrats stripping additional Covid-relief money from a government funding bill earlier this month at the 11th hour after lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were unable to reach an agreement on how to offset the new spending. According to an administration official, the White House has secured funding to vaccinate children under 5 years old and offer a fourth booster shot to the immunocompromised. Beyond that, however, any other measures would require additional approval from Congress. The White House says that, of the American Rescue Plan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s $1.9 trillion in funding, just $300 billion remains unobligated, $240 billion of which has been allocated for cities and states already. The remaining funding \u201a\u00c4\u00ec approximately $60 billion \u201a\u00c4\u00ec is left for use for a specific emergency use by agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Republican lawmakers have said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll oppose additional funding to fight the pandemic without guaranteed offsets, a demand one senior administration official told reporters was disingenuous, given previous votes to secure emergency funding under the Trump administration that did not have earmarked offset funding. But the White House is warning lawmakers that, absent more relief funds, there won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be sufficient money to subsidize a number of Covid mitigation steps, including programs that provide resources for vaccinations, reimburse providers and insurers for out-of-network treatment, underwrite Covid testing and supply personal protective equipment. The White House has spent much of the last several weeks amping up its warnings that aspects of the federal Covid-19 response will be curtailed if new funding is not approved, with administration officials speaking in dire terms in a call with reporters last week. Among the warnings on that call were that there is not enough money to purchase booster shots for all Americans if another dose is required; domestic testing capability will decrease; the purchase of monoclonal antibody treatments and preventative treatment for immunocompromised individuals will be significantly scaled back; sending vaccines to the rest of the world will be affected; and major effects would be seen on research and development on Covid treatments.

The shooting took place Monday on the grounds of East High School, though not within the school building. Gunshots were fired by multiple shooters from multiple vehicles, police said. A 15-year-old boy who did not attend the school was killed, and police said he was the intended target of the shooting. Two female students also were shot and remain hospitalized \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a 16-year-old in serious condition and an 18-year-old in critical condition, according to police. The incident is at least the 13th shooting at an American campus with K-12 students in 2022, according to a CNN tally. After the shooting, Des Moines police detectives carried out five residential search warrants and six vehicle search warrants and recovered six firearms, police said in a news release. Six Des Moines residents between the ages of 14 and 17 have been charged with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder, according to police. Police said they started receiving multiple calls reporting gunfire at the school at 2:48 p.m. and found the three victims outside when they arrived. All three were rushed to hospitals. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile this incident occurred outside of a school, it could have occurred in any one of our neighborhoods,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Des Moines police said on Facebook. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe school is where the suspects found their target. The rapid response by DMPD officers, and the swift action by the school staff placing the building in lockdown and sheltering students and staff in place, certainly had a positive impact on safety and scene management.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 East High School Student Kaylie Shannon told CNN affiliate KCCI that she was in a car outside the school when she heard shots. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI was just sitting in my friend\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s car and then all of the sudden I heard 11 gunshots and some boys screaming,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shannon said. The school went under lockdown for more than 40 minutes, but students were dismissed around 3:30 p.m. when police gave an all clear, according to a statement from Des Moines Public Schools. Sgt. Paul Parizek called the incident \u201a\u00c4\u00faa punch in the gut,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 KCCI reported. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe kids in that school are our community\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most precious cargo,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. East High School was closed Tuesday, the statement from Des Moines Public Schools said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe DMPS grief team will be available at East High for students and staff beginning tomorrow through the remainder of the week. School counselors will be available at our other schools for students who need additional support,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the district said in a news release. 1 teen is dead and 2 are in critical condition after shooting \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think we can all agree an event like this is everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s worst nightmare. Tonight, hug your students and love them,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Principal Jill Versteeg said in the statement. Shootings in and near schools have become too common, Superintendent Thomas Ahart said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur staff and students are forced to train for these incidents and the trauma associated with the repeated drills and incidents will remain with them for years to come. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unfortunate that our state and our country have become a place where firearms are far too easily accessible. We remain committed to protecting our students and staff, but real change to gun laws and access would go a long way to help us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ahart said in the statement.

The diplomatic spat is over a letter seeking support for a draft Russian resolution about aid in Ukraine. Canada posted the letter to Twitter with \"suggested edits\", which led to retweets from other UN missions. A Russian diplomat has called it \"Russophobic libel\". An image of the letter - annotated in red type - was posted on Canada's official UN mission Twitter account on Thursday. The letter, signed by Russian diplomat Vassily Nebenzia, had been sent to all UN members the previous day. In it, Mr Nebenzia says he is \"reaching out with regards to an urgent matter related to the dire humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine\". Canada's annotation adds to that line: \"which we have caused as a result of our illegal war of aggression\". The letter goes on to say that \"Western colleagues\" are \"politicising the humanitarian issue\". Canada adds \"Do you think the UN membership actually believes this? Please explain.\" Dmitry Polyanskiy, first deputy permanent representative of Russia to the United Nations, responded to the tweet, saying it \"shows that your diplomatic skills and good manners are at lowest ebb\" and reminding Canada that it twice failed to secure enough support to win a non-permanent seat on the powerful UN Security Council. The letter was meant to boost support for a draft resolution on providing humanitarian relief in Ukraine, which was scheduled for a vote on Friday at the UN Security Council. The resolution has been criticised by Western nations for its failure to mention Russia's responsibility for the war. That scheduled vote was cancelled by Russia on Thursday. The United States' envoy to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Russia's resolution was \"farcical\" and \"doomed to fail\", according to the AFP news agency.

Sherri Papini vanished in November 2016, launching a massive search, only for the Northern California mother of two to turn up three weeks later, telling investigators she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d been kidnapped, beaten and branded. California woman accused of hoax kidnapping was driven by 'narcissistic behavior,' sheriff says The Justice Department says Papini made the whole thing up. She was arrested last Thursday and has been charged with making false statements to a law enforcement officer and mail fraud, the department said in a news release. Papini, who had been detained since her arrest, appeared before a judge via Zoom on Tuesday. US Magistrate Judge Jeremy Peterson ruled she could be released on an $120,000 bond, with certain conditions, including that her travel be limited to only one part of California, that she must receive psychiatric treatment, must surrender her passport and cannot use firearms, among other terms. The judge addressed Papini directly, warning her that if she violated those conditions, there would be further penalties. Assistant US Attorney Veronica Alegria argued against Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s release, claiming Papini is an \u201a\u00c4\u00faextreme flight risk\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and has a \u201a\u00c4\u00falengthy pattern of dishonesty.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s alleged fraudulent disappearance was not without consequences to others: It cost upward of $230,000 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facountless hours\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of manpower, according to officials. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUltimately, the investigation revealed that there was no kidnapping,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 US Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said in the DOJ news release, \u201a\u00c4\u00faand that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted based on the defendant\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conduct.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out multiples times to Michael Borges, an attorney for Papini, for comment. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s virtual court appearance, Borges said his client has no intention to flee while she awaits trial. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s husband reported her missing November 2, 2016, after she failed to pick up her kids at day care. She was found three weeks later, alone on Interstate 5 about 140 miles from home. She told police she had been kidnapped by two women who wore masks and spoke Spanish. They held her at gunpoint, she said, kept her chained in a closet and branded her. But last week, the Justice Department said Papini was actually with an ex-boyfriend in Southern California and that she caused her own injuries in support of her abduction claim. In all, the cost of the investigation borne by public safety agencies was around $150,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a conservative estimate, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said in a statement on Facebook last week. But the cost isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t only measured in dollars, Johnson said. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case and her story diverted resources from real cases with real victims. Years ago, she told police she had been abducted, beaten and branded. Now she's charged with making it all up \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the sheriff said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faFinally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faall of law enforcement in Shasta (County) was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling (of) this case.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case cost the public in other ways, too. According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, between 2017 and 2021, Papini received $30,000 from the California Victim Compensation Board, which assists and reimburses victims of violent crimes for \u201a\u00c4\u00facrime-related expenses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 they suffer. In Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case, the affidavit says, $1,000 was used so Papini could buy blinds for her home and nearly $2,000 were paid to the ambulance provider who transported Papini after she was found. The rest of the money were payments for Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s therapy and treatment for anxiety and post-traumatic stress stemming from her supposed kidnapping. Then, there was the GoFundMe campaign that allegedly netted just over $49,000. Per the affidavit, donors were told the funds would be used to \u201a\u00c4\u00fafind and bring Sherri home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In fact, federal prosecutors say, more than $30,000 was withdrawn by a family member from the campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bank account and more than $11,000 was used to pay off the family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s personal credit cards. The remaining amount was \u201a\u00c4\u00faspent on personal expenses,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the affidavit says. A GoFundMe spokesperson told CNN the fundraiser has been removed from the platform and has not been actively receiving donations since 2016. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with law enforcement to assist with their ongoing investigation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the spokesperson said. Regarding the GoFundMe campaign, family spokesman Chris Thomas referred questions to Borges, the attorney for Papini. Last week, Thomas criticized Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s arrest, which the spokesperson said happened in front of her children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf requested, Sherri would have fully complied and come to the police station,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faas she has done multiple times before, where this could have been handled in a more appropriate way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini and her husband \u201a\u00c4\u00facooperated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with law enforcement, Thomas said, adding, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are confused by several aspects of the charges and hope to get clarification in the coming days.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Taylor Romine contributed to this report.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The US Commerce Department has said the planes are in contravention of US sanctions on Russia. Providing service to these aircraft anywhere in the world - including inside Russia - may lead to heavy fines and potential jail time, it says. The list includes aircraft operated by Russian airlines, including Aeroflot. While most are Boeing aircraft, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovich - the current owner of Chelsea football club - is also included. The Russian was among seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government earlier this month in response to the Ukraine war. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. In a statement, the department said any refuelling, maintenance or repair work of any of the listed aircraft - as well as the provision of spare parts - violates US export controls. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was in response to \"Russia's brutal war of choice against Ukraine\". She added: \"We are publishing this list to put the world on notice - we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.\" The department said violators face \"substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions\". The regulations apply to any aircraft which has more than 25% US-origin content that was re-exported to Russia after new controls came into effect on 24 February, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. \"By preventing these aircraft from receiving any service, for example, including from abroad, international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded,\" the statement added. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said the US government hoped the move highlighted Russia's increasing isolation from the global economy. \"Our actions aren't idle words or dead letters on the page,\" he said. \"They have real teeth and as Putin's vicious war continues, they will continue to bite harder on the Russian and Belarusian economies\". The US, Canada and European allies have already banned Russian aircraft from operating in their airspace, forcing Russian airlines to largely abandon their international routes.

The shooting took place Monday on the grounds of East High School, though not within the school building. Gunshots were fired by multiple shooters from multiple vehicles, police said. A 15-year-old boy who did not attend the school was killed, and police said he was the intended target of the shooting. Two female students also were shot and remain hospitalized \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a 16-year-old in serious condition and an 18-year-old in critical condition, according to police. The incident is at least the 13th shooting at an American campus with K-12 students in 2022, according to a CNN tally. After the shooting, Des Moines police detectives carried out five residential search warrants and six vehicle search warrants and recovered six firearms, police said in a news release. Six Des Moines residents between the ages of 14 and 17 have been charged with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder, according to police. Police said they started receiving multiple calls reporting gunfire at the school at 2:48 p.m. and found the three victims outside when they arrived. All three were rushed to hospitals. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile this incident occurred outside of a school, it could have occurred in any one of our neighborhoods,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Des Moines police said on Facebook. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe school is where the suspects found their target. The rapid response by DMPD officers, and the swift action by the school staff placing the building in lockdown and sheltering students and staff in place, certainly had a positive impact on safety and scene management.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 East High School Student Kaylie Shannon told CNN affiliate KCCI that she was in a car outside the school when she heard shots. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI was just sitting in my friend\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s car and then all of the sudden I heard 11 gunshots and some boys screaming,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shannon said. The school went under lockdown for more than 40 minutes, but students were dismissed around 3:30 p.m. when police gave an all clear, according to a statement from Des Moines Public Schools. Sgt. Paul Parizek called the incident \u201a\u00c4\u00faa punch in the gut,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 KCCI reported. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe kids in that school are our community\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most precious cargo,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. East High School was closed Tuesday, the statement from Des Moines Public Schools said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe DMPS grief team will be available at East High for students and staff beginning tomorrow through the remainder of the week. School counselors will be available at our other schools for students who need additional support,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the district said in a news release. 1 teen is dead and 2 are in critical condition after shooting \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think we can all agree an event like this is everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s worst nightmare. Tonight, hug your students and love them,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Principal Jill Versteeg said in the statement. Shootings in and near schools have become too common, Superintendent Thomas Ahart said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur staff and students are forced to train for these incidents and the trauma associated with the repeated drills and incidents will remain with them for years to come. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unfortunate that our state and our country have become a place where firearms are far too easily accessible. We remain committed to protecting our students and staff, but real change to gun laws and access would go a long way to help us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ahart said in the statement. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) of Kansas City went to the scene to assist in the investigation, the agency tweeted. Other agencies assisting with the investigation include the Iowa State Patrol, Polk County Sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office, the FBI and the Des Moines Public Schools Department of Public Safety.

Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the measure, which would bar teachers from teaching these topics to children under 10 years old. Critics say the bill will isolate LGBT youth. Proponents say it is about empowering parents on education issues. Activists have dubbed it the Don't Say Gay bill. It is officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Bill. The Republican-backed legislation passed on Tuesday. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics \"when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\". White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday decried the passing of \"hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students\". President Joe Biden and his administration are \"with LGBTQI+ students everywhere\", she wrote on Twitter. State laws that ban or constrain the discussion of LGBT life in classrooms - sometimes called \"no promo homo\" laws by critics - are not uncommon. Four US states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas - currently have laws on the books that explicitly prohibit or limit sex education to heterosexual activity. The Florida bill also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Representative Joe Harding, who sponsored the bill in Florida's statehouse, has said that the bill is simply about \"empowering parents\". Critics say that vague language in the law could result in teachers and students being prevented from discussing their lives even outside the classroom. \"This is really about making it impossible for LGBT young people to speak for themselves,\" said Nadine Smith, the executive director of advocacy group Equality Florida. Todd and Jeff Delmay - one of the first same-sex couples to get married in Florida - say this bill would make it impossible for their 11-year-old son Blake to talk freely about his dads. \"We have fought and won these battles to adopt children and to be a family and to be together,\" Todd told the BBC. \"And they are now trying to find every way in which they can erase us and our families.\" And the couple warned the bill could marginalise LGBT youth as they  come to terms with their identity. \"A child's need for acceptance in a safe space should always take precedence over some parents' belief,\" Todd said, adding that legal challenges were already under way. The Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative group that supports the bill, said in a statement last week that it was \"necessary because government schools in the US have become ideological, political and are more interested in shaping a child's politics and sexual inclinations than they are in teaching academics of reading, writing, math, and education\". Governor DeSantis - widely regarded as a possible 2024 White House contender - endorsed the bill last month, saying it was part of a wider effort to make the education system \"transparent\" to parents. The Florida bill is part of a fierce debate taking place across the US over children's education, how schools operate and what they teach. Why are certain books being banned in US?

The Department recommends that children with underlying conditions are the best candidates for the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 it says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faParents are encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits with their children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health care practitioner when evaluating whether their child should receive a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for children with underlying health conditions or comorbidities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Florida is the first state to break from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations that everyone age 5 and older receive the vaccine. Why Florida is now recommending healthy kids *not* get vaccinated against Covid-19 Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Lapado announced the measure on Monday during a roundtable discussion hosted by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Explaining the decision, DeSantis said Ladapo was concerned that the vaccine was \u201a\u00c4\u00fabeing pushed on people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are not just going to follow the CDC in the state of Florida,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to do our own stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The guidance released Tuesday says that the risks of the vaccine outweigh its benefits in children who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have underlying health conditions. It cites reports of increased incidence of myocarditis \u201a\u00c4\u00ec inflammation of the heart muscle \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in 16- and 17-year-olds who got the Covid-19 vaccine. The study that the guidance uses to support this concern also found that the risk of myocarditis is rare, identifying 105.9 cases per 1 million doses of the mRNA vaccine given in 16- to 17-year-olds. Florida surgeon general favorably recommended after Democrats walk out of confirmation hearing The guidance also cites data from a clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found no cases of severe Covid-19 in a group of children ages 5 to 11, whether they received the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. However, that study found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing Covid-19 infection. The department also based the guidance off a New York-based study that found vaccine effectiveness for children ages 5 to 17 dropped significantly during the Omicron surge. But that research concluded that the vaccine continued to be effective against severe disease in children. That study is a preprint and has not been published in a peer-reviewed professional journal, so a note in bold at the top of the study advises that it should not be used to guide clinical practice. Health experts have been very critical of the department\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recommendations. CDC director rebukes DeSantis for scolding high school students over masks: 'It is absolutely their choice' In a statement Tuesday, Dr. Daniel P. McQuillen, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said his group \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrongly opposes the state of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to put politics over the health and safety of children. The Florida Surgeon General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to recommend against COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children flies in the face of the best medical guidance and only serves to further sow distrust in vaccines that have proven to be the safest, most effective defense against severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The head of the University of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health system sent an email Tuesday to staff that distanced the medical network from Ladapo in light of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Dr. David Nelson, the senior vice president for health affairs at the university and president of UF Health, told staff that Ladapo does not speak for the school and acknowledged that his opinions clash with those of other medical experts. Ladapo is a professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine through an agreement with the state. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

President Joe Biden signed a bill into law on March 14 that awards a Congressional Gold Medal to the women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, nicknamed the \u201a\u00c4\u00faSix Triple Eight.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The honor was granted \u201a\u00c4\u00fain recognition of their pioneering military service, devotion to duty, and contributions to increase the morale of personnel stationed in the European theater of operations during World War II,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the bill states. The bipartisan bill, introduced by Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), was passed by the Senate in April 2021 and the House last month. The Six Triple Eight was a unit made up of about 850 Black women who were tasked with overcoming a massive backlog of mail, according to the Department of Defense. The unit traveled to Great Britain in 1945, surviving encounters with Nazi U-boats and a German rocket explosion along the way, before spending months sorting through mail and packages stacked to the ceiling in unheated warehouses, according to the US Army Center of Military history. They adopted the motto, \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo mail, low morale.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The unit set up a new mail tracking system and cleared the six-month backlog of mail in just three months, the center said. By the end of the war, the unit processed about 17 million pieces of mail, according to the National World War II Museum. Like much of the country, the military was segregated throughout World War II. Black service members faced continuous racism, and the women of the 6888th have sharp memories of being segregated on trains, spat at and demeaned by White men and women. The unit later was moved to France and then ultimately disbanded without fanfare in 1946. There were no commemorative ceremonies for members when they came home at the end of the war. The Six Triple Eight was led by Army Maj. Charity Earley (n\u221a\u00a9e Adams), who later rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. She died in 2002, and her son praised the belated recognition last year. These Black female soldiers brought order to chaos and delivered a blow against inequality \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wonderful, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stanley Earley III. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt should have happened 50, 60 years ago. But there is now the opportunity for a recognition that these folks did all these things that were so important.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 As of last summer, only seven members were believed to still be alive, he said. The medal is part of a belated recognition of the unit\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s efforts in recent years. A monument honoring the battalion was dedicated in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 2018. A documentary, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Six Triple Eight: No Mail, Low Morale,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 celebrated the mail tracking system the battalion created.

Earlier this week, a ProPublica report revealed Mr Thomas failed to disclose trips he took with real estate mogul Harlan Crow almost every year over the course of two decades, despite being required to file annual disclosures of gifts. In a statement on Friday, Mr Thomas said that he had been told by colleagues and others that \"this sort of personal hospitality\" did not need to be formally disclosed. Mr Thomas is one of nine justices on the Supreme Court serving lifetime appointments after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. Here is a look at the conservative justice and his eight colleagues who sit on the bench, including the Supreme Court's most recent member, Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal chosen by President Joe Biden last year. Jackson's appointment has not altered the 6-3 conservative majority on the court. On the court since: 23 October 1991 How he got to the court: Thomas was born in a small town in Georgia, and was one of the few African-Americans in attendance during a short stint in seminary and then at Holy Cross College. But unlike Justice Sotomayor, those experiences made him distrustful of affirmative action policies. After finishing Yale Law, he worked in Missouri government and in Washington DC before being named chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency that responds to discrimination claims in the workplace. After a bruising confirmation hearing - in which a former employee accused him of sexual harassment - Thomas was narrowly confirmed to Supreme Court, at the relatively young age of 43. Who is he as a justice? Thomas' originalism is exacting, including a disregard for stare decisis, respect for prior court rulings and precedence. Thomas has also not asked a question during oral arguments in nine years. He has previously said he doesn't care for the question-heavy arguments, sometimes already drafting opinions based on written briefs before any lawyer gets up to argue. Thomas often files entirely separate dissents rarely joined by others, but Coyle says he is influential in other ways, including during conferences only justices attend, and in \"difficult decisions\" in areas that don't get a lot of press - like intellectual property and tax law. Thomas replaced the first African-American justice on the court - Thurgood Marshall. On the court since: 3 October 2022 How she got to the court: The first black woman to sit on the court in its 233-year history is also the first justice since 1967 to come to the court with extensive experience as a criminal defence attorney. Before the US Supreme Court, the Washington DC native served on the influential US court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. Ms Jackson has said she has a \"methodology\" to deciding cases but not an overarching philosophy.\u00a0Some conservatives have accused her of being \"soft\" on criminals, pointing to her experience as a public defender and willingness as a federal judge to issue prison sentences below federal guidelines. Her confirmation came after President Biden pledged during his presidential campaign to appoint a black woman to the top court. On the court since: 31 January 2006 How he got to the court: Alito grew up in New Jersey in an Italian immigrant family. While at Princeton University, he was involved in conservative and libertarian groups, as well as the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps. After Yale law school, he was a prosecutor in New Jersey and served in the Reagan administration in the justice department, including as assistant to the solicitor general, where he argued before the Supreme Court. President George HW Bush named him to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1990, where he stayed until his nomination to The Supreme Court. Who is he as a justice? Alito is a conservative justice, but one who does not hew as often to originalism as fellow conservatives Scalia and Thomas. He is not always talkative in oral arguments  but his questions are sharp, aiming to pick apart an argument's logic. Alito has a low public profile despite being a large part of the court's rightward shift on business, campaign finance and racial issues over the past decade. The former prosecutor has been \"very pro-government\" in criminal cases, Coyle says, and has shown less willingness than his conservative colleagues to protect free speech in cases where it is harmful or hateful. On the court since: 7 August 2010 How she got to the court: Kagan grew up in New York City. At the age of 12, she convinced her rabbi to hold the synagogue's first formal bat mitzvah, the rite of passage for young women. After law school at Harvard, she clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. After a successful stint as the first female dean of Harvard Law School, she was briefly US solicitor general - the federal government's top representative at the US Supreme Court, before being nominated by President Barack Obama for the high court. Who is she as a justice? Kagan is the first justice in decades not to previously serve as a judge. She is part of the court's left-leaning wing, but has been the author of many of recent unanimous or near unanimous decisions. Her writing is often easy for a layperson to understand without sacrificing legal analysis, and she is an aggressive questioner during oral arguments. Kagan first took her seat at the bench at the age of 50 and could potentially be a force on the court for decades. Lithwick says Kagan is \"much more inscrutable\" on issues than other recent additions to the court. \"She's very close to the vest,\" she says. On the court since: 29 September 2005 How he got to the court: Born in New York and raised in Indiana, Roberts attended a boarding school as a teenager but also spent summers working in a steel mill. After considering becoming a historian at Harvard, he went to law school there instead, eventually clerking for then-Associate Justice Rehnquist. He spent many years as a lawyer in the Reagan administration then entered private practice, arguing before the high court and serving as one of several legal advisers to George W Bush in the Florida presidential recount case. Originally nominated to fill the spot left by retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Roberts was re-nominated for the chief justice position after Chief Justice Rehnquist died between terms, and his nomination was fast-tracked. Who is he as a justice: A conservative justice, Roberts is the third-youngest Chief Justice in the court's history, confirmed at 50 years old. Last year's term saw more than half its cases decided unanimously, something many court watchers cite as the outcome of Roberts' desire to foster agreement through narrower rulings. He also notably wrote the 5-4 opinion that shot down a major challenge to President Barack Obama's healthcare law. \"I think he cares deeply about how the 'Roberts court' looks,\" Lithwick says, and knows he can move the court slowly over decades. \"He doesn't want huge swings, except in areas he feels very strongly about,\" Coyle says, like government's role in racial issues, campaign finance's relation to free speech and the structure of constitution. Roberts also looks to keep decorum on the bench during oral arguments. On the court since: 8 August 2009 How she got to the court: Sotomayor was born to Puerto Rican parents in the Bronx. As a student at Princeton University, she fought for hiring more Latino professors and admitting more Latino students. After Yale Law school, she became a prosecutor in New York and was later named to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal appeals courts are often the final step before the Supreme Court for cases. In the second circuit, Sotomayor authored more than 150 majority opinions - including a few that were ultimately overruled by the higher court. Who is she as a justice? Sotomayor is the first Hispanic justice. She's also been one of the most public facing - her memoir appeared on the New York Times' best-selling list, she appeared twice on Sesame Street, once to adjudicate a dispute between Goldilocks and Baby Bear, and she helped drop the ball in Times Square on New Year's Eve 2013.  \"She's trying really hard to demystify the court, showing 'You can be a justice too',\" Lithwick says. Her former experience as a prosecutor and trial judge often leads her to challenge lawyers on the facts of a case, says Marcia Coyle, the chief Washington correspondent for the National Law Journal. \"She knows how criminal trials operate,\" Coyle says. On the court since: 10 April 2017 How he got to the court: At 49, Gorsuch was the youngest nominee in a quarter of a century when he was approved in 2017. The Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. He began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, and worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Who is he as a justice? Gorsuch succeeded the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and was welcomed by conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law. In his first year on the court he has cemented the 5-4 conservative advantage, and that's been seen in a series of rulings on contentious issues such as the Trump travel ban, trade union fees and gerrymandering. On the court since: 6 October 2018 How he got to the court: Kavanaugh served on the influential Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit and was formerly a White House aide under George W Bush. He previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. His confirmation process was one of the most controversial in recent years amid allegations of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, which he denied. After a hearing in which one of his accusers gave a dramatic testimony of the alleged incident and Kavanaugh fiercely defended his record, he was approved by the Senate by 50-48. Born in Washington, DC in 1965, Kavanaugh studied at Georgetown Preparatory School an all-boys school in Bethesda, Maryland, and graduated from Yale College and Yale Law School. Who is he as a justice? He succeeded Anthony Kennedy, who was the Supreme Court's swing vote, often casting the deciding opinion in 5-4 cases, consolidating a conservative majority at the top court. Some Democrats fiercely opposed to his name for his views on delicate issues such as abortion. His views on the environment and gun rights have also raised concerns among environmentalists and gun control activists. On the court since: 27 October 2020 How she got to the court: Born in New Orleans of Irish and French ancestry, Barrett was the eldest of seven children in a devoutly Catholic family and is now herself a mother of seven. She was the student body vice-president at her all-girls Catholic high school. After graduating first in her class at Notre Dame Law School, in Indiana, she clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, and later worked on George W Bush's election lawsuit in 2000. Barrett also became a distinguished law professor at her alma mater. She was picked for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 by President Donald Trump and was nominated to the high court less than three years later. Who is she as a justice? Often considered a protege of Justice Scalia, Barrett is a proponent of textualism, the view that judges should apply the law as written and interpret the US Constitution as it was originally intended. In her acceptance speech at the White House, Barrett said: \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\" She has said her Catholic faith does not influence her rulings. Past legal opinions and remarks on abortion and gay marriage have made her popular with the religious right, but have earned her vehement opposition from the left. She drew scrutiny for her reported leadership role, with the title of \"handmaid\", in the People of Praise, a tight-knit, Christian faith-based group.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The House of Representatives passed the legislation which seeks to end discrimination against natural hair at work and school. The Crown (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) Act must still be approved by the Senate. President Joe Biden has urged lawmakers to swiftly pass the law. Black Americans say they are often treated unfairly at work and in schools because of their natural hair textures or protective styles like braids, knots, twists and locs. If the Crown Act becomes law, natural hair discrimination would be treated as if it were race or national origin discrimination under federal civil rights law. Until then, advocates say that employers and institutions can discriminate against black Americans based on how they style their natural hair. Adjoa B Asamoah, legislative strategist for the CROWN Coalition, praised Friday's vote in the House, but acknowledged a potential uphill battle in the Senate. \"There's the shift in policy and then there's a shift in culture,\" Ms Asamoah said. \"This is about confronting this Eurocentric standard of beauty, tackling anti-blackness, and lifting the natural African aesthetic. The diversity of Blackness is beautiful.\" The CROWN Coalition partners with more than 85 organisations to pass statewide bans on hair discrimination, and advocate for the bill nationally. Just on Thursday, the Massachusetts House of Representatives unanimously voted to advance its bill to its state senate. A third of black children in majority-white schools have faced race-based hair discrimination, according to a 2021 study by DOVE and the CROWN Coalition. The survey found 86% of children say they have experienced it by the age of 12. More than a dozen states have already passed similar laws aimed at ending hair discrimination. Just on Thursday, the Massachusetts House of Representatives unanimously voted to advance its bill to its state senate. When Chicago mother Ida Nelson was told her four-year-old son Jett's braids were prohibited by his pre-school, she says she thought administrators were joking. But when the school told her the hairstyle must be removed in order for him to go class, she decided to fight back. After months of campaigning, Ms Nelson was able to get the Jett Hawkins Act, which prohibits hair discrimination in schools, passed in Illinois. She said Friday's move to advance the national Crown Act made her feel \"vindicated\". \"When we step into our power, epic things get done,\" she added. \"This was a collective effort from everyone from four-year-olds to senior citizens coming together to say, 'No, our hair and our ability to show up as our authentic selves is not negotiable'.\" A statement from President Biden said he believed \"no person should be denied the ability to obtain a job, succeed in school or the workplace, secure housing, or otherwise exercise their rights based on a hair texture or hair style\".

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Airstrikes on an art school and a maternity hospital. Residential apartment buildings taking fire from tanks. More than 900 civilians killed in a matter of weeks. Is Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal? His country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine has presented reams of evidence that have led some world leaders \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including US President Joe Biden last week \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to use the loaded label. The question now is what Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which he followed up by calling Putin a \u201a\u00c4\u00famurderous dictator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapure thug\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will mean for the war in Ukraine going forward. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t signal any concern that Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks would roil talks with Russia. He told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Fareed Zakaria that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faready for negotiations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with Putin. (More on this in a minute.) Biden's strategy with Putin is decades in the making Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments represented a major moment since leading officials had mostly avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. But soon after the President uttered the words \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think he is a war criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to reporters at an unrelated event, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the comment was \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom the heart.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Other officials used similar language. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hard not to walk away with that conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 State Department spokesman Ned Price later told CNN. And after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he \u201a\u00c4\u00fapersonally\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 agreed with Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s label of Putin, Psaki told reporters that the top US diplomat was speaking from the heart \u201a\u00c4\u00faas well.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Why all the parsing? While terms like \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar crimes\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are often used colloquially, they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Conventions, which specify intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime. In other words, the White House is being careful to not get ahead of the international investigations probing Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Will Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s words complicate Ukraine-Russia negotiations? The Kremlin called Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks about Putin being a war criminal \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Asked if it would be hard to sit down with Putin, Zelensky maintained Sunday that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ready \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and has been ready. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout delay,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 warning that otherwise Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s losses would be \u201a\u00c4\u00fahuge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The problem, as CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security team reports, is that US and NATO officials believe Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s engagement truly is \u201a\u00c4\u00ec even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Everything you need to know about war crimes and how Putin could be prosecuted The view from the State Department. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday also expressed her personal view that war crimes are being committed in Russia, saying that they \u201a\u00c4\u00faall feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but noted that there must be \u201a\u00c4\u00faa body of proof\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 before a legal determination can be made. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there is virtually no one \u201a\u00c4\u00ec maybe Vladimir Putin is the exception \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who can look at all of the photographs, all of video coming from Ukraine and not believe that Putin is intentionally targeting civilians, and intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in an interview with CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s John Berman on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow, I think we all feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sherman said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in terms of international law, you have to have evidence, you have to have a body of proof that in fact there was intentionality.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added that the United States is \u201a\u00c4\u00fahelping to pull that evidence together, present it to international justice parties and then have a legal threshold that is met.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 How long do war crime investigations take? Investigations at the International Criminal Court take many years, and only a handful of convictions have ever been won. Put differently, it could be a while before Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 remarks have any legal weight \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if ever. As we noted earlier this month, the court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia.

The House of Representatives passed the legislation which seeks to end discrimination against natural hair at work and school. The Crown (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) Act must still be approved by the Senate. President Joe Biden has urged lawmakers to swiftly pass the law. Black Americans say they are often treated unfairly at work and in schools because of their natural hair textures or protective styles like braids, knots, twists and locs. If the Crown Act becomes law, natural hair discrimination would be treated as if it were race or national origin discrimination under federal civil rights law. Until then, advocates say that employers and institutions can discriminate against black Americans based on how they style their natural hair. Adjoa B Asamoah, legislative strategist for the CROWN Coalition, praised Friday's vote in the House, but acknowledged a potential uphill battle in the Senate. \"There's the shift in policy and then there's a shift in culture,\" Ms Asamoah said. \"This is about confronting this Eurocentric standard of beauty, tackling anti-blackness, and lifting the natural African aesthetic. The diversity of Blackness is beautiful.\" The CROWN Coalition partners with more than 85 organisations to pass statewide bans on hair discrimination, and advocate for the bill nationally. Just on Thursday, the Massachusetts House of Representatives unanimously voted to advance its bill to its state senate. A third of black children in majority-white schools have faced race-based hair discrimination, according to a 2021 study by DOVE and the CROWN Coalition. The survey found 86% of children say they have experienced it by the age of 12. More than a dozen states have already passed similar laws aimed at ending hair discrimination. Just on Thursday, the Massachusetts House of Representatives unanimously voted to advance its bill to its state senate. When Chicago mother Ida Nelson was told her four-year-old son Jett's braids were prohibited by his pre-school, she says she thought administrators were joking. But when the school told her the hairstyle must be removed in order for him to go class, she decided to fight back. After months of campaigning, Ms Nelson was able to get the Jett Hawkins Act, which prohibits hair discrimination in schools, passed in Illinois. She said Friday's move to advance the national Crown Act made her feel \"vindicated\". \"When we step into our power, epic things get done,\" she added. \"This was a collective effort from everyone from four-year-olds to senior citizens coming together to say, 'No, our hair and our ability to show up as our authentic selves is not negotiable'.\" A statement from President Biden said he believed \"no person should be denied the ability to obtain a job, succeed in school or the workplace, secure housing, or otherwise exercise their rights based on a hair texture or hair style\".

Sharif, the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-N party and younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, received 174 out of 342 votes in Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote in parliament and is set to serve as prime minister until the next general election, which is expected to take place in 2023. All of Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lawmakers from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party resigned en masse in protest ahead of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote, and there will now have to be urgent elections to replace them. Following the vote, Khan called on his supporters to take to the streets. His next rally is scheduled for April 16 in Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan. In a speech to parliament ahead of his swearing in, Sharif spoke of unity across the country, including his coalition government. He said he would introduce a 10% increase in pensions and raise the monthly minimum wage rate to Rs 25,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec equivalent to US $136 per month. India\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Sharif in a Twitter post that added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIndia desires peace and stability in a region free of terror, so that we can focus on our development challenges and ensure the well-being and prosperity of our people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s appointment as the 31st prime minister of Pakistan comes after widespread protests in support of Khan erupted across Pakistan late Sunday. Tens of thousands took to the streets in key cities, including Lahore and Peshawar, to support the ousted leader. They chanted slogans against the United States \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which Khan had claimed was involved in a conspiracy against him \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s powerful military, which had seemed to withdraw its support from him. Against this backdrop of political turmoil and a crumbling economy, Sharif now faces a challenging period as the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader. Unlike Khan, Sharif has maintained an amicable relationship with the military and was a popular chief minister of Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s politically important and most populous province of Punjab. He was lauded for his ambitious administrative and infrastructure projects in the province, which saw advances in the education and industrial sectors. Sharif was instrumental in driving the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a part of China\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Belt and Road Initiative, and maintains a positive relationship with Beijing. A member of the wealthy Sharif dynasty, which amassed millions by producing steel, his family was mired in scandal after his brother Nawaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison and handed a $10.5 million fine over corruption charges in 2018. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan ousted as country's leader following vote of no-confidence Shehbaz Sharif rejected the verdict, calling it \u201a\u00c4\u00faflawed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapolitically motivated.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shehbaz Sharif is also facing charges for alleged corruption. In recent months, Sharif had led a campaign to remove Khan as Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader over claims of economic mismanagement and poor governance. Along with the opposition, he had urged Khan to resign ahead of a no-confidence vote that was widely expected to dismiss Khan. Tensions smoldered for days, with Khan repeatedly rejecting the criticism and instead claiming the moves against him were an attempt at regime change backed by Washington and some members of the opposition. The allegations were denied by both the US State Department and the Pakistani opposition. In a dramatic series of events, the deputy speaker in parliament blocked the no-confidence vote against Khan. Khan then dissolved parliament and called for early elections. The opposition challenged Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s moves in Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court, with Sharif calling them \u201a\u00c4\u00fanothing short of high treason.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The court ruled last week that the blocking of the no-confidence vote against Khan was unconstitutional, paving the way for Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rise to power.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

The Department recommends that children with underlying conditions are the best candidates for the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 it says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faParents are encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits with their children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health care practitioner when evaluating whether their child should receive a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for children with underlying health conditions or comorbidities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Florida is the first state to break from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations that everyone age 5 and older receive the vaccine. Why Florida is now recommending healthy kids *not* get vaccinated against Covid-19 Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Lapado announced the measure on Monday during a roundtable discussion hosted by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Explaining the decision, DeSantis said Ladapo was concerned that the vaccine was \u201a\u00c4\u00fabeing pushed on people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are not just going to follow the CDC in the state of Florida,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to do our own stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The guidance released Tuesday says that the risks of the vaccine outweigh its benefits in children who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have underlying health conditions. It cites reports of increased incidence of myocarditis \u201a\u00c4\u00ec inflammation of the heart muscle \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in 16- and 17-year-olds who got the Covid-19 vaccine. The study that the guidance uses to support this concern also found that the risk of myocarditis is rare, identifying 105.9 cases per 1 million doses of the mRNA vaccine given in 16- to 17-year-olds. Florida surgeon general favorably recommended after Democrats walk out of confirmation hearing The guidance also cites data from a clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found no cases of severe Covid-19 in a group of children ages 5 to 11, whether they received the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. However, that study found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing Covid-19 infection. The department also based the guidance off a New York-based study that found vaccine effectiveness for children ages 5 to 17 dropped significantly during the Omicron surge. But that research concluded that the vaccine continued to be effective against severe disease in children. That study is a preprint and has not been published in a peer-reviewed professional journal, so a note in bold at the top of the study advises that it should not be used to guide clinical practice. Health experts have been very critical of the department\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recommendations. CDC director rebukes DeSantis for scolding high school students over masks: 'It is absolutely their choice' In a statement Tuesday, Dr. Daniel P. McQuillen, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said his group \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrongly opposes the state of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to put politics over the health and safety of children. The Florida Surgeon General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to recommend against COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children flies in the face of the best medical guidance and only serves to further sow distrust in vaccines that have proven to be the safest, most effective defense against severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The head of the University of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health system sent an email Tuesday to staff that distanced the medical network from Ladapo in light of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Dr. David Nelson, the senior vice president for health affairs at the university and president of UF Health, told staff that Ladapo does not speak for the school and acknowledged that his opinions clash with those of other medical experts. Ladapo is a professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine through an agreement with the state. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. Nelson also assured staff that the university\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s position was that vaccines are \u201a\u00c4\u00fasafe and effective, with a very low risk of adverse outcomes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe recognize there is sometimes significant disagreement among knowledgeable individuals on policy issues surrounding the COVID pandemic.

Four journalists have so far been killed reporting on the war and many more are injured or missing. Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna has been missing for more than a week, and her outlet believes she is being held by Russian forces. However, Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief of the Kyiv Independent, said journalist Oleh Baturyn, who was kidnapped last week in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Kakhovka, was just released by Russian fighters. The Kyiv Independent is a fairly new publication but has earned acclaim for its war coverage. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone from being a three-month-old startup and a relative unknown in the Western world to now one of the leading sources of information on the war in Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on Reliable Sources Sunday.

Rudenko said the outlet is learning as they go when it comes to protecting employees who have suddenly found themselves war correspondents. Several of the Independent\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reporters already had experience working in a war zone following Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

TWO MEN POSED AS FEDERAL AGENTS, PROVIDED SECRET SERVICE OFFICERS WITH IPHONES, APARTMENTS, OFFICIALS ALLEGE Federal law enforcement agencies enter an apartment building in Washington, D.C. (Fox News Digital/Kelly Laco) Federal prosecutors said that the Federal Bureau of Investigations executed a search warrant on Wednesday for five apartment units and three vehicles in relation to this case, where multiple firearms, law enforcement equipment, servers, and hard drives were found. Department of Homeland Security and Naval Criminal Investigative Service training manuals were also found. A detention hearing will take place on Friday for both men. Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey ordered the two men be held until the hearing on Friday. A binder with a list of every resident at the apartment complex was also found, according to prosecutors. While executing the search warrant, prosecutors say that Ali's passport shows two Pakistani and Iranian visas. The federal prosecutors also allege that Ali told two witnesses that he has some type of connection with the Pakistani Intelligence Service, the Inter-Services Intelligence. Ali allegedly made multiple trips to Doha, Qatar since 2019, according to prosecutors. During Thursday's hearing, prosecutors also alleged that Taherzadeh admitted to deleting social media accounts once he found out about the federal investigation. Federal law enforcement agencies enter an apartment building in Washington, D.C. (Fox News Digital/Kelly Laco) Both men are currently U.S. citizens, according to the prosecutors. The two men are accused of falsely posing as employees of the Department of Homeland Security who worked on a special task force related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Prosecutors allege that the individuals posed as law enforcement officers in an attempt to integrate with legitimate federal agents. One of the people who was given gifts previously worked on the first lady's security detail, according to federal prosecutors. The prosecutors also allege that Taherzadeh and Ali obtained firearms, which include handguns and assault rifles that are used by federal law enforcement agencies. Taherzadeh provided members of the U.S. Secret Service with rent-free apartments, iPhones, surveillance systems, a drone, a flat screen television, storage for an assault rifle, and more, prosecutors say.

Greg Abbott directs use of buses to drop off migrants at steps of Capitol in DC\n    Article Content: Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin updates 'The Faulkner Focus' on the growing number of Democrats warning President Biden against reversing Title 42. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Wednesday that undocumented migrants released into his state will be shipped to the steps of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., as border checkpoints struggle to manage the flow of people attempting to enter the United States and the Biden administration's move to eliminate the Title 42 expulsion provision. The state will provide charter buses to drop off migrants \u2013 many released into small Texas communities that officials say are overwhelmed \u2013 in Washington, the Republican governor said in a news conference. \"We are sending them to the United States Capitol where the Biden administration will be able to more immediately address the needs of the people that they are allowing to come across our border,\" Abbott said. He noted that cities along the Texas-Mexico border have bused migrants to San Antonio. \"So I said I got a better idea. As opposed to busing these people to San Antonio, let's continue the ride all the way to Washington D.C.,\" Abbott said. The first location where migrants will be dropped off is the U.S. Capitol, officials said. W. Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said his agency will \"use as many buses as we need\" to follow Abbott's directive. In past emergencies, up to 900 buses have been activated for evacuations, he said. In addition, Abbott signed an order directing the state Department of Public Safety to conduct \"enhanced\" inspections of vehicles crossing into the U.S. from Mexico to ensure residents are not put in danger by unsafe vehicles or unsafe drivers. He also announced actions to deter illegal immigration, such as using razor wire in low-water crossings. This week, the Texas National Guard will begin the first phase of \"mass migration\" rehearsals in preparation for a potential influx of migrants at the border, officials said.

Mark Riddell, 39, who helped wealthy parents buy their children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s way into universities, was also sentenced to two years of supervised release after his prison sentence. He was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and submit to $239,449 in forfeiture, according to Caroline Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the US Attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office for Massachusetts. Before the sentencing, former USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic was found guilty of conspiracy and fraud for soliciting and accepting bribes to facilitate admissions of students in the scam. The college admissions scam's test-taking guru pleads guilty Riddell, a standardized test-taking savant, was paid to either ace SATs and ACTs in students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 place, or correct the students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 answers before they were handed in, prosecutors said. CNN has reached out to Riddell\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorney for comment. Riddell, one of many people caught up in the wider scheme in 2019, pleaded guilty that year to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Authorities arrested and charged Riddell, dozens of parents, college coaches and administrators in the sprawling 2019 investigation known as \u201a\u00c4\u00faOperation Varsity Blues.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Riddell agreed to a plea deal in 2019 that calls for incarceration at the low end of sentencing guidelines for the charges. Federal prosecutors have suggested a 33- to 41-month sentence, a law enforcement source told CNN that year. He had faced up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors have said Riddell was associated with William \u201a\u00c4\u00faRick\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Singer, a former college admissions coach who masterminded the scam. Singer, prosecutors said, ran two general scams: First, to cheat on standardized tests for students whose parents paid; and second, to use Singer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s connections with college sports coaches and use bribes to get paying parents\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 kids into school with fake athletic credentials. Riddell was a key player in the testing scam, prosecutors said. For years starting in 2011, Singer, the owner of a college prep business, bribed test administrators to let Riddell take tests in students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 place or correct students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 answers, prosecutors said. Singer would funnel money from a bogus charity, to which his clients donated, to test administrators at a Los Angeles private school and a public high school in Houston, authorities said. Riddell was paid $10,000 per test, prosecutors said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe was just a really smart guy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Andrew Lelling, US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said at a March 2019 news conference. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have any side information about the correct answers. He was just smart enough to get a near-perfect score on the exam or to calibrate the score.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Singer, who aided the investigation, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges, and is awaiting sentencing. US Attorney for Massachusetts Rachael Rollins said her office is \u201a\u00c4\u00fagrateful\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for the verdict in the Vavic case, part of what she called \u201a\u00c4\u00faarguably one of the largest scandals in the history of academia.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faTo say that the conduct in this case was reprehensible is an understatement,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rollins said at a press conference. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe rich, powerful and famous, dripping with privilege and entitlement, used their money and clout to steal college admissions spots from more qualified and deserving students.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Vavic accepted bribes from Singer. Vavic was accused of designating certain USC applicants as water polo recruits, thereby facilitating their admission to the university, by relying on fake athletic resumes, in exchange for bribes. He was fired in March 2019 after his allegations of his involvement in the scam were made public. On Friday, Stephen Larson, an attorney representing Vavic, said they are \u201a\u00c4\u00fadisappointed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the jury\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision finding Vavic guilty of all of the charges against him. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are disappointed with but respectful of the jury\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Larson said. The vast majority of those charged have pleaded guilty and served out their sentences, generally measured in weeks or months. Among the more high-profile parents charged in the test-taking portion of the scheme was actress Felicity Huffman, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for paying $15,000 to the Singer to boost her older daughter\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s test scores. Huffman spent 11 days in jail in 2019. Another actress, Lori Loughlin, spent two months in prison and her husband Mossimo Giannulli spent five months in prison for paying $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake recruited athletes.

Ghost guns are one of many issues facing regulators and policymakers looking to address a spike in gun violence that began in early summer 2020. Gun homicides drove the uptick. Here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what you should know about ghost guns: Ghost guns are untraceable, self-assembled firearms, often put together with parts sold online, sometimes in as little as 30 minutes. Growing ghost gun problem adds to America's violence woes The weapons, sometimes referred to by officials as \u201a\u00c4\u00faprivately made firearms,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or PMFs, do not have serial numbers, making them all the more difficult to track and regulate. Purchasing kits to build ghost guns online does not require a background check, so buyers can sidestep the typical requirements that might come with buying a firearm. This means anyone \u201a\u00c4\u00ec no matter their age or criminal record \u201a\u00c4\u00ec can buy the kits and assemble a weapon. Calls for something to be done about ghost guns have grown as their use in shootings across the US has proliferated, with the weapons recovered at crime scenes in some big cities more frequently. While ghost guns make up a relatively small percentage of the total number of guns recovered by law enforcement, officials in several cities have reported sharp increases in those tallies, a CNN analysis of 2021 data found. In San Francisco, for example, about 20% of the nearly 1,100 guns it seized in 2021 were ghost guns, police there told CNN. And New York is on pace to again shatter the previous year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total, according to data shared with CNN. Since the start of this year, the NYPD has recovered 163 ghost guns, compared to 29 over the same period in 2021, mayor Eric Adams said Monday. In 2021, New York authorities seized 4,497 firearms \u201a\u00c4\u00ec  375, or 8.33%, were ghost guns. Of the 12,088 guns recovered in Chicago last year, 455, or 3.76%, were ghost guns, according to data from the city, up from 130 ghost guns recovered in 2020, when ghost guns made up 1.15% of the 11,343 guns recovered. Between 2016 and 2021, the ATF received 45,000 reports of privately made firearms recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations, including 20,000 reported last year alone. The agency was able to trace only 1% of the 45,000, officials said, because the firearms lack serial numbers. The number of guns the ATF traced rose from about 217,000 in 2015 to just over 393,000 in 2020. Just this past week, a ghost gun was recovered outside the home of a suspect arrested for the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old girl in the South Bronx, a police source told CNN. The regulation the Biden administration announced Monday addresses a gap in the government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to track ghost guns, requiring background checks before kit purchases and inclusion of serial numbers on some pieces used to assemble weapons. Biden to announce new gun regulation and name ATF nominee \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Biden administration is making sure these kits are treated as the deadly firearms they are,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 a senior administration official said ahead of the announcement. The new rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check, which is required for other kinds of firearm purchases. Those selling kits will also be required to include a serial number on the components that make up the weapon, so the eventual firearm can be traced. Additionally, the new rules mandate firearm dealers add a serial number to already-assembled ghost guns they come across. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no longer a ghost,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said in the Rose Garden on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt has a return address. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to help save lives, reduce crime and get more criminals off the streets.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN Political Briefing Podcast: Biden tackles gun violence At least 10 states and Washington, DC, have already taken steps to restrict or ban the purchase or use of ghost guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Maryland was the latest to join last week, when the governor allowed legislation to pass that altered the definition of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafirearm\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to include an unfinished frame or receiver and prohibiting the sale of such components, among other steps. Maryland joins 10 states and DC becoming latest to place restrictions on ghost guns Republican Gov. Larry Hogan thanked the legislature for addressing untraceable firearms in a letter. But he said the legislation did not go far enough to hold accountable those who actually commit shootings. Last October, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed legislation last October aimed at tackling the epidemic of gun violence, including prohibiting \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe sale of ghost guns and requiring gunsmiths and dealers in firearms to register firearms in their possession,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. In the meantime, federal authorities have been cracking down on those who are either in possession of ghost guns or looking to traffic them. Four men were charged in Baltimore last month with conspiracy and dealing firearms \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including ghost guns \u201a\u00c4\u00ec without a license, per the US Attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office in Maryland. In January, a Rhode Island man was charged by the US Attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office of the Southern District of New York for allegedly selling or attempting to sell more than 100 guns he made at his home. According to the Justice Department, the 34-year-old allegedly purchased the parts, made them at his home in Providence, Rhode Island, and then sold the completed weapons. He was charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic firearms and one count of making false statements, the DOJ said in a news release.

Philadelphia, known as the City of Brotherly Love, has had 96 homicides so far this year, falling one murder short of the notoriously violent Chicago three months into 2022. As of Monday, there had been 96 homicide victims in Philadelphia in 2022. According to Philadelphia Police Department statistics, that represented a 9% spike from the 88 homicide victims the city recorded at the same time last year. At the end of 2021, Philadelphia recorded a total of 562 homicide victims, compared to 499 in 2020 and 356 in 2019. WOMAN SHOT IN HEAD DIED; PHILLY HOMICIDES UP 11% YEAR TO YEAR: REPORT By comparison, Chicago has seen 97 homicide victims this year as of Monday, a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department, told Fox News Digital on Tuesday. From Jan. 1 through March 7, 2022, at 11:59 p.m. local time, Chicago police recorded 372 shooting incidents that impacted 432 victims, the spokesperson said by email. The gruesome statistic comes as Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw was expected to provide an update Tuesday afternoon following the deadly police shooting of 12-year-old Thomas Siderio, who investigators say first fired shots at approaching officers last week. The scene of a shooting of a 12-year-old girl, who was hospitalized in stable condition in February 2022, police said. (FOX29 Philadelphia WTXF) Amid the controversy, Philadelphia police officials sounded the alarm about what they described as an \"execution style murder\" early Tuesday in the city\u2019s Strawberry Mansion section. A man in his 20s sitting in a parked and running car on North 32nd Street was struck 15 times in his face, head and chest. Ballistic evidence showed over 30 shots were fired from two semi-automatic guns. No arrests were made. Over the weekend, three young men, ranging in age from 18 to 20, were all found shot to death either inside or lying beside a stolen vehicle Saturday evening in Philadelphia's West Oak Lane neighborhood. \"There\u2019s no fear of being caught carrying a gun illegally in the city of Philadelphia,\" Joe Sullivan, a retired Philadelphia police deputy commissioner, told Fox News Digital by phone Tuesday. \"It\u2019s the job of the police and the district attorney to create that perception of fear among bad guys that if you get caught with a gun, there will be swift and certain consequences.\" Sullivan argued that Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner\u2019s policies of not prosecuting or not fully prosecuting gun-related crime in Philadelphia have contributed to a drastic increase of violence. \"You\u2019re always going to have dysfunctionality when the police and the DA are not able to work independently of one another but cooperatively,\" Sullivan said. \"When it comes to violent crime, they need to be on the same page.\" District Attorney Larry Krasner addresses the media after a press conference announcing Danielle Outlaw as the new police commissioner on Dec. 30, 2019, in Philadelphia. (Mark Makela/Getty Images) As a progressive, Krasner has been advocating for criminal justice reform. But Sullivan said the district attorney just needs to hold a small group of repeat violent offenders accountable, meaning if an individual is a previously convicted felon, has a criminal record, or is caught with a gun while selling narcotics, prosecutors should follow the mandatory sentencing guidelines laid out by law. \"You can follow a timeline of the rise in homicide and the rise in violent crime and compare that to when the present DA took office, and you can see the relationship very easily. Without a doubt, the communities that are most impacted are communities of color \u2013 somewhere between 85 and 95% of all homicide victims in the city of Philadelphia are citizens of color,\" Sullivan said. \"What concerns me, whether you\u2019re a reformed DA or a conservative DA, if you have an increase of crime within your jurisdiction, you should be always be willing to take a second look at what you\u2019re doing,\" he said of Krasner. \"But he seems very unwilling to acknowledge that some of his policies have not had the intended consequences.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition to the district attorney, Sullivan also attributed the issue of violent crime to a lack of manpower and morale at the police department from the fallout of George Floyd\u2019s death. \"Like most police departments, Philadelphia is having a very hard time recruiting new applicants,\" Sullivan said. \"We\u2019ve seen a mass exodus of officers to early retirement and transferring laterally to other police departments, so the police department is severely understaffed right now, meaning there\u2019s also very little proactive policing going on.\" \"The lack of proactive policing is also driven by a perception that there\u2019s a lack of support for the police and a concern of if they get involved in any type of controversial incident how it\u2019s going to be handled by the administration and the district attorney,\" he said. \"You put all that together you have a recipe for disaster.\" Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

One worshipper knocked the axe from the man's hands, and held him down until police arrived, local media reports. A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene in the suburb of Mississauga, and he has since been charged. Some congregants had minor injures from the bear spray, the mosque's imam said. One of the worshippers said the experience was \"terrifying\" and described hearing a scream before turning around to see a man holding an axe and using bear spray - similar to pepper spray - against three people. \"By the time he was spraying, the people in the first row realized something was going on and one of the young men turned around and knocked away the axe before he had a chance to use it,\" Noorani Sairally told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. The young man then held the alleged assailant down until police arrived, the witness said. \"Before he could inflict harm on any worshippers, several congregants bravely were able to stop him in his tracks,\" imam Ibrahim Hindy said in a statement, describing the moment the attacker entered the site. \"Our community will never be broken and we refuse to be intimidated,\" he added. Police have named the man they arrested as Mohammad Moiz Omar, and charged him with six offences including assault with a weapon and administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm. Following initial uncertainty over a possible motive, investigators now say they believe the attack was a \"hate-motivated incident.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of a number of high-profile Canadian public figures to condemn the attack, which he described as \"incredibly disturbing\" and applauded the courage of the worshippers at the mosque.

The leading Democrat is asymptomatic, her spokesman said on Thursday. Mrs Pelosi, 82, was seen hugging former President Barack Obama during his visit to the White House on Tuesday and standing close to President Joe Biden. According to the latest US guidelines, quarantine is not required after Covid-19 exposure for those vaccinated. Both Mr Biden and Mr Obama have been vaccinated, and the current president tested negative on Wednesday, the White House said. He is not considered a close contact under the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Mrs Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill said: \"The Speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, and is thankful for the robust protection the vaccine has provided\". \"The Speaker will quarantine consistent with CDC guidance, and encourages everyone to get vaccinated, boosted and test regularly\". The news of Mrs Pelosi's diagnosis comes as the US approaches 1 million Covid-19 related deaths since the start of the pandemic. After a steep spike in infections in December - fuelled by the highly contagious Omicron variant - Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions have fallen precipitously since mid-January.

In a statement, the Academy said the 94th Oscars had been \"overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behaviour we saw Mr Smith exhibit on stage\". Smith has apologised for his actions and resigned from the Academy. The actor hit Rock for joking about his wife's shaved head, a result of the hair-loss condition alopecia. Less than an hour later, he was awarded the best actor award for his role in King Richard, where he played the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards ceremony, met virtually on Friday to discuss disciplinary action. In a statement, it said banning Smith was aimed at protecting performers and guests and \"restoring trust in the Academy\". The Academy said that directly after the slap it did not \"adequately address the situation in the room\" and had been \"unprepared for the unprecedented\". It apologised for this. It also thanked Rock for \"maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances\". In his resignation statement, Smith said he had \"betrayed the trust of the Academy\" and was \"heartbroken\" over his actions. He added he would \"fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct\". Smith's resignation means he will be unable to vote for future Oscars. The Academy's disciplinary review over the incident, originally scheduled for 18 April, was fast-tracked after he resigned. Few have ever stepped down from the Academy. Four members - producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Bill Cosby, director Roman Polanski and cinematographer Adam Kimmel - have been booted over sexual misconduct allegations, while actor Carmine Caridi was expelled in 2004 for pirating screener videos given to him. But the standards of conduct laid out by the film academy contained various disciplinary options for Smith, such as excluding him from future Oscars ceremonies, revoking his eligibility for awards or taking back his newly won Oscar. Only one Oscar has ever been taken back; a feature called Young Americans won the best documentary honour in 1969 but was found to be ineligible for the award that year. Late last month, actor Whoopi Goldberg - a member of the Academy's board of governors - predicted Smith would face \"big consequences\" but said \"we're not going to take that Oscar away from him.\" Beyond the Academy's actions, at least two studios - Sony and Netflix - are pausing their projects with Smith. Rock, who began his latest stand up comedy tour shortly after the Oscars telecast, has not commented publicly on the slap. He told fans at a show last month that he is \"still kind of processing what happened\" and will talk about the incident \"at some point\".

Delta Air Lines head Ed Bastian told the BBC the final impact \"really depends where fuel prices settle\". Oil prices have reached 14-year highs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Emirates, Japan Airlines and AirAsia are among the big carriers to introduce surcharges on their tickets recently to cover the higher cost of jet fuel. Before the pandemic, in 2019, 200 million customers flew on Delta, making it the world's second biggest airline by passenger numbers. Mr Bastian said that on a domestic US flight the rise in fuel prices \"is probably about $25 on a ticket, that could be anywhere between 5% to 10% at these high levels of oil... and international [flights] will be a bit higher than that\". Delta is planning to introduce fuel surcharges on the international flights which account for about 35% of its business, and increase US ticket prices. Jet fuel is one of the biggest costs for airlines. Michael O'Leary, the boss of Europe's biggest carrier Ryanair, said recently that the surge in oil prices would lead to \"materially higher\" airfares this summer. Many airlines try to protect themselves from these changes by buying fuel in advance. Easyjet and British Airways both said recently that they had done so for 60% of their fuel needs this year. This year has seen big fluctuations. At the start of January, Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil - was under $80 a barrel, but it recently reached as high as almost $130 as the US and UK said they would end their use of oil from the world's biggest exporter, Russia. More price swings are likely in the short-term according to the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Dr Fatih Birol. He told the BBC: \"I think the $100 [oil] we are experiencing today may not be the highest level of prices we'll be seeing in the next weeks\". He warns that will be felt across all areas of the global economy, because as well as higher transport costs it will lead to more expensive heating and electricity. That would exacerbate the cost of living crisis many countries are facing. Reports from India suggest it is considering tackling high prices at the petrol pumps by buying discounted Russian oil. Many won't purchase it because of western sanctions, and Dr Birol warned: \"One shouldn't forget that every single dollar for oil going to [the] Russian economy will go back as a tank or as a bullet to Ukrainian people. One shouldn't forget this moral aspect in my view\". Instead he wants Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia to increase oil production. The latest IEA forecast says three million barrels a day of Russian oil could be removed from the market. However, that drop in supply could be offset by a fall in demand from China where Covid has led to new lockdowns. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on...Russian gas and oil All this unpredictability means Delta does not try to buy its fuel in advance, Mr Bastian said. \"Sometimes you win, and often you lose.\" Instead Delta has the protection of owning its oil refinery in Pennsylvania, although it has been unsuccessful in recent efforts to try to sell it. \"We're thrilled that we have it right now\" says Mr Bastian. The Delta chief is also looking to a future where initiatives to tackle climate change by cutting aviation's carbon emissions mean oil prices are less of a concern. \"The existing fossil fuel and jet fuel technology needs to go, and we need to make those investments for the future towards a sustainable future.\" This means moving towards sustainable fuels such as biofuels or synthetic alternatives made through chemical processes. Mr Bastian says that cost is the big impediment, with the production of such substitutes costing \"three to five times what's in the marketplace today\". The difference will need to be made by governments investing in scaling up production. \"Scale will bring costs down over time, and will bring more capital from private sources into exploration and looking for new technology. This next five years is critical that to make sure we get government support, not just in the US but around the world.\" Returning to profitability after the losses of the pandemic will also help fund the development of new technologies. According to the International Air Transport Association the industry lost more than $51bn last year with global demand 58.4% down on 2019 levels. As Covid restrictions continue to ease, Delta had two record days of sales last week, leading Mr Bastian to be hopeful about the outlook. \"The world is returning to travel and governments have decided that Covid is done.\" \"We're seeing some of our largest bookings we've ever had in our history. And it's not just in the US, it's internationally as well.\" However, he adds that Asia is lagging behind other regions. Crucially demand for lucrative business class fares is also returning. It is currently at about 60% of pre-pandemic levels, but Mr Bastian expects this to rise to 70% by the summer. He concedes \"there's forms of business travel that will never return, that are more efficient to handle over video technology\", but adds that leisure travellers are now showing more willingness to splash out on premium services. Last year Delta recorded a pre-tax loss of $3.4bn and the disruption caused by coronavirus at the start of this year means Mr Bastian thinks that will be added to at the start of this year. \"We will lose some money primarily because of Omicron, it's not fuel prices. But I do expect starting in the second quarter and beyond that we'll be profitable.\" You can watch Ed Bastian and Dr Fatih Birol's full interviews on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend.

Those in captivity were forced to sing a parody of the Eagles' pop song \"Hotel California\" retitled \"Hotel Osama\", Nicolas H\u00e9nin said. It contained the lines: \"you will never leave/if you try, you will die\". Mr H\u00e9nin was the latest witness in the trial of El Shafee Elsheikh. The IS militant cell was known as the Beatles because of their British accents. An alleged member of the militant cell known as \"Jihadi George,\" Mr Elsheikh, 33, is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US, accused of kidnapping and conspiracy to murder. The court on Wednesday heard from Mr H\u00e9nin, who was abducted in June 2013 while working in Raqqa, Syria. He was blindfolded by men with AK-47s in the middle of the day and driven out of town, he said. When the blindfold was removed, he found himself alone in a cell, and would later come into contact with several other hostages. Mr H\u00e9nin testified that he witnessed brutal torture and was himself beaten until unconscious by men believed to be the so-called Beatles. The group have been linked to some 27 abductions and the murders of four Americans - journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. Prosecutors in the case argue that Mr Elsheikh was deeply involved in making ransom demands from the families of hostages for the group, and involved in the executions they carried out. He is also charged with conspiring in the deaths of the British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. The defence, however, have said that the Sudanese-born Londoner was not part of the group and merely \"a simple Isis fighter\". Mr H\u00e9nin said that he saw Mr Haines, who was starved and tortured so much that he \"at first sight looked like somebody at a Nazi concentration camp\", and Mr Foley, who was weak from \"intense torture\" and had had his ribs broken. Another captive, the Danish journalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, was \"a shadow of a man... so badly tortured that he was mentally and physically diminished\". Wounds on his wrists were \"so deep you could see his bones\", Mr H\u00e9nin said. He also encountered Ms Mueller, Mr Sotloff and Mr Kassig during his captivity, the Frenchman said. They arrived at various point during his detainment, he said, and were at one point held together in a small underground room they nicknamed \"the Dungeon\". Mr H\u00e9nin was released in April 2014, but others were not so lucky. Several family members of victims have testified about email exchanges with the captors as part of the prosecution's case. Earlier on Wednesday, the father of Peter Kassig recounted receiving a letter from his son saying he \"knew it was his time\", predicting his death before he was executed. Mr Elsheikh - on Wednesday wearing a white shirt and black face mask - sat back in his chair and listened intently to Mr Kassig's testimony, cocking his head slightly to look at the government's evidence, and making no eye contact with the witness. He took extensive notes when Mr H\u00e9nin testified. The trial continues, with as many as 50 witnesses expected.

Four journalists have so far been killed reporting on the war and many more are injured or missing. Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna has been missing for more than a week, and her outlet believes she is being held by Russian forces. However, Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief of the Kyiv Independent, said journalist Oleh Baturyn, who was kidnapped last week in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Kakhovka, was just released by Russian fighters. The Kyiv Independent is a fairly new publication but has earned acclaim for its war coverage. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone from being a three-month-old startup and a relative unknown in the Western world to now one of the leading sources of information on the war in Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on Reliable Sources Sunday. Rudenko said no one on her team has been directly targeted yet, but reporting on the conflict is a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadaily risk.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have to remember that this is an invasion by an authoritarian regime that has been targeting journalists and media consistently for decades now,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rudenko said. Rudenko said the outlet is learning as they go when it comes to protecting employees who have suddenly found themselves war correspondents. Several of the Independent\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reporters already had experience working in a war zone following Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Now they are once again working in dangerous locations, including Kyiv. One of the outlet\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s biggest fears is that Russian forces may cut off internet connections, hindering their ability to publish news. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe do not concentrate\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in one place, Rudenko said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are in different locations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Work goes on, but there is an emphasis on avoiding unnecessary risks. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are also telling reporters that safety is a priority,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rudenko said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo story is worth a human life.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But the psychological impacts will last after the war, Rudenko said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faJust being thrown into this,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rudenko said of the toll the fighting is taking. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis new reality where we cover this horror every day and every hour.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Kayla Mueller, 26, was one of several people who died at the hands of a Syria-based IS terror cell dubbed the Beatles due to their British accents. On Tuesday, her mother Marsha spoke at the federal trial of El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, known as \"Jihadi George\". He has denied charges of hostage-taking and conspiracy to murder. Mr Elsheikh is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US and the only alleged member of the notorious Beatles cell to do so. He has been linked to at least 27 abductions, but has asserted that he was not part of the group. The Sudanese-born Londoner, who was stripped of his British citizenship in 2018, is accused of taking hostages, resulting in the deaths of four Americans - Ms Mueller, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. He is also charged with conspiring in the deaths of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. In opening statements last week, his lawyer argued that he was \"a simple ISIS fighter\" who went to Syria alone to support \"suffering Muslims\". But prosecutors played back past media interviews with Mr Elsheikh that contradict the claim he was not involved in the hostage taking scheme. During one interview, Mr Elsheikh describes asking the jailed Ms Mueller for an email address to reach her family, although he goes on to say he never sent any emails. Inside the Virginia courthouse on Tuesday, Ms Mueller's mother described exchanging several emails with the IS captors, in which she begged for her daughter's life. In their first contact with the so-called Beatles, she and her husband Carl were asked to submit proof of life questions for Ms Mueller to answer. Later emails include a video addressed to then-IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in which Marsha wore a hijab \"to show respect\". The Beatles wrote back demanding either a ransom of five million euros or the release of jihadist Aafia Siddiqui from a US federal prison, within 30 days. Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman sometimes known as \"Lady Al-Qaeda\", is serving 86 years for the attempted murder of US soldiers. When the Muellers replied they were retired and the payoff was \"more than [what] we could earn in several lifetimes\", the captors wrote: \"get back to work\", the court heard. The Obama administration had reassured the Muellers that \"IS won't harm a woman\", Marsha testified. But US officials confirmed in February 2015 that Ms Mueller had been killed in custody. Her body was never recovered. Marsha sat just yards away from the accused, who sat still leaning back in his chair and took no notes during the testimony. As the court broke for lunch, Omar Alkhani, who was Ms Mueller's boyfriend and was attending court with her family, got up from his seat, lent over the bar and pointed towards Mr Elsheikh as he was being escorted out. Mr Alkhani raised his voice in Arabic and said: \"He is in hell you will see him there,\" in an apparent reference to the former commander of the prison where Ms Mueller had been held before she died. Emotions continued to run high into the afternoon, with the father of Mr Sotloff - an American Israeli freelance journalist beheaded in 2014 - struggling to hold back tears on the stand. Arthur Sotloff told the court that the first ransom email he received from the kidnappers described his son as having played a prominent role in \"the US government's battle for the hearts and minds of Muslims\". In the note, the hostage takers called for the release of \"all Muslim people imprisoned directly or indirectly by Americans\" in return for the junior Sotloff's return. Arthur said he had no choice but to keep quiet as the group had demanded media silence. The Sotloffs too sent a video message to their child's captors, playing to their supposed piety by stating that Islam is a merciful religion and the Prophet Muhammad would want them to act differently. Months later, they heard their son's voice for the last time. In an apparently coerced recording, Mr Sotloff asked his family to fight for him and said \"my life lies in the hands of President Obama\". On 3 September 2014, Arthur found out by a news alert that his son had been executed in a publicly released video. He was visibly shaking when he walked off the stand and was comforted by Ms Mueller's father as they left the court. A day earlier, James Foley's mother had testified that she had at first hoped reports her son had been executed were \"some cruel joke\". She told the court: \"It just seemed too horrific.\" Mrs Foley said it only sank in when President Barack Obama confirmed on television that James had been executed. The Elsheikh trial continues and is expected to last three to four weeks.

A San Francisco jury on Monday found a police officer facing four counts of assault and battery charges not guilty after four days of deliberation. District Attorney (DA) Chesa Boudin, who first announced charges against San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Officer Terrance Stangel in December 2020, was accused of withholding evidence in the case earlier this year. Stangel was accused of unnecessarily beating a Black man named Dacari Spiers with a baton in October 2019, breaking Spiers' wrist and leg, while responding to a domestic violence call. \"We are thankful that the jury was able to see through the dishonesty of the DA\u2019s office in this case and see it for what it was \u2013 unjust and unsupported,\" Stangel's attorney, Nicole Pifari, said in a statement Monday evening following the verdict in a San Francisco Superior Court. \"Everyone should be deeply concerned about this case, about this District Attorney, and about the rule of law in San Francisco.\" Police officer Terrance Stangel, second from the left, enters Department 27 at the Hall of Justice with his attorney Nicole Pifari on Monday, March 7, 2022, in San Francisco, California.

It is unclear if prosecutors will refile the charge. SAN FRANCISCO DA CHESA BOUDIN ACCUSED OF WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE IN OFFICER MISCONDUCT CASE Boudin thanked the jury \"for their careful consideration of this case over the course of four full days of deliberation\" in a Monday statement. \"We respect the jury process, although we remain disappointed that police accountability remains so elusive and difficult to achieve,\" he said. \"I am committed to continuing to hold those who commit harm accountable \u2013 regardless of the uniform they may wear or the badge they may carry.

Hayashi told Caffese\u00a0that she never disclosed information from a female witness who claimed to see Spiers beating a woman before Stangel hit him with a baton and that she feared she would be fired if she did, according to the outlet. SAN FRANCISCO DA BOUDIN'S OFFICE \u2018THREATENED\u2019 INVESTIGATOR MULTIPLE TIMES TO WITHHOLD EVIDENCE: TRANSCRIPT Pifari filed a motion to dismiss the case on Jan. 24, citing \"prosecutorial misconduct\" and \"deceptive\" methods by the DA's office.

Spiers and his girlfriend begged the officers to stop, and he was left with \"horrendous blows with his hands and wrists, which caused severe injuries, including a severely broken wrist,\" the complaint states. Spiers accused the city of violating his civil rights. On March 2, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted Spiers' motion to sanction the city and county of San Francisco for withholding evidence from Spiers. Video footage of the incident released last year shows a chaotic scene in which Spiers questions officers' use of force, saying he didn't do anything. Stangel was acquitted of felony charges, including battery with serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon and assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury. He faced up to seven years in prison, according to the Chronicle. Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

Chuck Grassley. Finkenauer pledged Monday to \u201a\u00c4\u00fachallenge this deeply partisan decision to the Iowa Supreme Court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Sunday night, Polk County District Judge Scott Beattie ruled that Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name \u201a\u00c4\u00fashall not be included on the primary ballot for the Democratic Primary for U.S. Senate.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The ruling centers around a dispute over the signatures required to get on the ballot. Although Finkenaur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign submitted more than the necessary 3,500 signatures, the judge found that she did not meet the requirement that each candidate have at least 100 signatures from at least 19 Iowa counties due to questions about three signatures obtained from Allamakee and Cedar counties. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Court takes no joy in this conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beattie wrote. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis Court should not be in the position to make a difference in an election, and Ms. Finkenauer and her supporters should have a chance to advance her candidacy. However, this Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s job is to sit as a referee and apply the law without passion or prejudice. It is required to rule without consideration of the politics of the day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finkenauer initially responded to the decision by saying her campaign was \u201a\u00c4\u00faexploring all of our options to fight back hard.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Later on Monday, Finkenauer announced she would challenge the decision with the Iowa Supreme Court.

The success of Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge will now rest with seven justices on Iowa\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00ec only one of whom was appointed by a Democrat. If Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge is unsuccessful, the former congresswoman could accept the ruling and run as a write-in candidate in the June primary. This could be complicated by the fact that although Finkenauer, a former congresswoman, was the front-runner in the Democratic field, she is running against two other Democrats: Glenn Hurst, a city council member in Minden, Iowa, and Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral. Republicans have been challenging Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signatures, initially bringing the complaint to the State Objections Panel. The state body decided in March that Finkenauer could stay on the ballot, but just narrowly. The panel found that Finkenauer submitted at least 100 signatures from 20 counties and needed 19. One of those counties was knocked out by the objection but she was able to squeak by with 100 signatures in one challenged county and 101 in two others. But Republicans successfully brought this lawsuit, saying the panel incorrectly interpreted the law. Iowa Republicans celebrated the decision on Monday, with Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann arguing that the questions surrounding Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signatures shows a \u201a\u00c4\u00fasevere lack of enthusiasm behind Iowa Democrats.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot qualifying for the ballot is a complete and utter embarrassment,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kaufmann said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

During an interview with federal and local investigators, Papini was warned that it was a crime to lie to federal agents upon being presented with evidence that she had not been abducted. Instead of retracting the story, she allegedly doubled down. Fox News has reached out to Papini's attorney for comment. The multi-state search for her and the five-year search for who reportedly kidnaped her diverted resources from other cases, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said. In total, the investigation costs $150,000, by conservative estimates, he said in a Facebook post last week. \"Not only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters, but in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain,\" he wrote. \"All of law enforcement in Shasta county was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling this case.\" Undated photo of Sherri Papini.

A shooting near a New York City school killed one 16-year-old girl and injured another girl and teenage boy who were caught in the middle of a dispute as they were possibly walking home, authorities said Friday. The gunfire erupted just before 1:45 p.m. at the corner of East 156th Street and St Ann's Avenue outside University Heights Secondary School in the Bronx, the New York Police Department said. One suspect was standing on a corner \"gesturing\" to someone on an opposite corner, police said. After some back-and-forth, the suspect pulled out a firearm and opened fire, authorities said. The three victims were walking on the street and were struck by gunfire. The girls, both, 16, were both struck \u2013 one in the chest and the other in the leg. The one hit in the torso has died, the NYPD told Fox News Digital.

Or maybe, when St Patrick's Day approaches, you'd think of the parade in New York or the Chicago River being dyed green. However, there is a city and a town that both lay claim to be America's most Irish and chances are you may not have heard of either. One is a former mining city in the north west and the other a town in the heart of America's \"Irish Riviera\". According to the 2010 census, the Massachusetts coastal town of Scituate is home to a higher concentration of people who trace their ancestry back to Ireland than any other town or city in the United States. Just under half of the town's population said they were of Irish heritage, although that figure dropped slightly in 2020. The figure in Plymouth County, in which the town is situated, stands at slightly more than 30% Irish-American. The South Shore of Massachusetts is an area stretching from south of Boston to Cape Cod, which has been affectionally referred to as the \"Irish Riviera\" for many years. Between 1820 and 1930, it is estimated that as many as 4.5m Irish people arrived in America. While large numbers of emigrants from Ulster in the 1700s settled in the Appalachian region and southern states, many of the newer emigrants settled in the north east. In the 1850s a Boston fisherman and Irish immigrant, Daniel Ward, found Irish moss, also known as carrageenan, growing beneath the rocks on Scituate's shores. It was not only a potential food source, but was also used as a thickening agent used in cosmetics, desserts, beer, paint, and more. This was the beginning of the Irish mossing industry on the South Shore. Later, with its proximity to Boston, Irish-American residents of that city holidayed, bought second homes and in many cases permanently relocated to Scituate and the surrounding towns on the South Shore. Siobh\u00e1n Hunter, of the Scituate Sister City West Cork Committee and whose father was originally from Belfast, says \"Irishness has been instilled in our everyday lives here\". \"It is a part of us,\" she adds. \"You'll see Irish surnames on businesses all around town and the South Shore, Irish flags hung all year round, painted Irish flags on pedestrian walks in Sand Hills, an annual Easter Rising Memorial and now permanent monument in our harbour.\" The town, which has a population of about 19,000 also, of course, pulls out all the stops for St Patrick's Day. \"We have a massive St Patrick's Day parade that attracts 15,000 to 20,000 people from all over,\" says Siobh\u00e1n. \"We tend to enjoy at least a week of celebrations and find that most everyone joins in on the spirit of St Patrick's Day, in one way or another. \"We are a country that is made up of generations of immigrants, from all over the globe. Therefore, it's not just about celebrating contributions of Irish, but all immigrants.\" Scituate has been \"sistered\" or \"twinned\" with the West Cork area of Ireland since 2016. \"We have a cultural exchange, which includes everything from delegations to marketing ideas, coastal flood management, environmental science, as well as student exchanges,\" Siobh\u00e1n says. \"From the Scituate West Cork Sister City Committee also spawned the idea of the South Shore Irish Heritage Trail, inspired by Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way. \"It is the hope to not only educate people that live in these areas as to the contributions and sacrifices of Irish and Irish-Americans, but also people from all over the world.\" While Scituate can claim the title of most Irish town in the US, Butte, Montana, has often been referred to as the most Irish city in the country. Around a quarter of Butte's population claim Irish heritage. but the influence of Irish culture on the former mining town's history is also important. Teresa Scott of the Montana Gaelic Cultural Society says the main reason so many Irish came to live in Butte is copper. \"Butte is a mining town and copper was king in the late 1800s and early 1900s,\" she says. \"Irish came to work the copper mines in Butte and the surrounding area.\" The Montana Gaelic Cultural Society sponsors language immersion weekends, the An Ri Ra Montana Irish Festival and gives grants to educational groups that promote Irish music, dance and heritage. \"We don't just represent the Irish, but all Celtic nations,\" Teresa says. Mike O'Connor of the Montana Ancient Order of Hibernians says in its time Butte has had more people per capita with Irish decent than any other city in the United States and still retains the sense of Irishness. He added that there are St Patrick's Day parades throughout Montana. \"Also at our state capitol in Helena we raise the Irish flag on St Patrick's Day. \"We have been doing this for 37 years. We are the only capitol in the United States to do this.\" Teresa describes St Patrick's Day, when the city's population of 35,000 people is swollen by thousands of visitors, as \"the high holy day in Butte\". \"It's celebrated on 17 March with a parade, dancing, music, food and drink,\" she says. \"In Butte you can walk around with your beverage in public and with spring break falling in the same week, it gets a bit rowdy in uptown Butte, especially if it's a sunny day with no wind or snow. \"There is a family friendly event in the evening called Handing Down the Heritage where we have local Irish dancers and bands, along with bagpipers. It's a grand time. \"Other cities have parades and Irish dancers and music, but Butte is where everyone wants to be.\" Like Scituate, she says other ethnic groups join in the St Patrick's Day celebrations. \"Butte is very ethnically diverse,\" Teresa says. \"Many different nationalities came to work in the mines and stayed - Italians, Finnish, Serbians, Chinese, Norwegian, Croatian, Greek, Lebanese, Welsh and Cornish. \"On 16 March Butte celebrates the Finnish St Urho Days. He chased the grasshoppers, some say frogs, out of Finland. \"It is the precursor for the St Patrick's Day celebration.\" So while there may be debate as to who can claim the title of America's most Irish town, what is certain is that after Covid restricted events last year, this year's St Patrick's Day events will be celebrated with even more gusto than usual.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Source: Johns Hopkins University and national public health agencies Figures last updated: 5 July 2022, 08:59 BST The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available. Deaths are falling in many areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Data on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. Using this metric, researchers from the Lancet medical journal suggest that more than 18 million people may have died because of Covid up to the end of 2021. That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease. Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period. Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses. According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%. Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant. Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. Asia Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture. North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province. In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions. Europe Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic. In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. North America The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. Latin America Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously. Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June. Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people. Africa Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low. According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country. Middle East Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year. The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases. In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. Oceania Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus. Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths. In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years. Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies. When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult. Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic. The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Figures for France are for the mainland only and include both suspected and confirmed cases.

Her appearance comes days after her husband Jared Kushner, also an ex-White House adviser, met investigators. The questioning lasted up to eight hours, US media reports. Unlike other witnesses called before the committee, Ms Trump never attempted to invoke her right to remain silent, according to the panel's top chairman. \"She's answering questions,\" congressman Bennie Thompson said. \"Not in a broad, chatty term, but she's answering questions.\" The committee has also subpoenaed White House records of Mr Trump's meetings and actions on 6 January, but documents acquired by BBC media partner CBS News show no presidential contacts for more than seven hours, as the battle in the Capitol was at its most intense. That runs counter to multiple reports of presidential phone calls to Republicans in the US Capitol, including a heated conversation with House minority leader Kevin McCarthy. Ms Trump could shed light on the methods her father used communicate that day. One Democratic member of the committee described Mr Kushner's testimony as \"helpful\" in reconstructing the events of the day. As with Mr Kushner and the more than 800 other individuals called by the committee, Ms Trump's testimony has taken place in private. Public hearings are expected in May.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A 72-year-old woman accused of hate crimes against her Vietnamese neighbor has agreed to sell her Seattle-area home as part of a civil agreement with the victim and her family, according to reports. As per the agreement, Jan Myers, who is White, is expected to sell her home in Shoreline, Washington, about nine miles from downtown Seattle, within the next six months and pay the victim, Thi Pham, who is Vietnamese American, $45,000 from that sale, KGW reported. If Myers fails to move from the neighborhood before the time frame is up, the case could be referred to a civil jury. NYC TEEN CHARGED WITH HATE CRIME AFTER GROUP ATTACKS HASIDIC MAN IN BROOKLYN The ordeal began in April 2021 when Pham said she was outside in her front yard gardening when she noticed Myers sitting in the roadway staring at her and beginning to move her car back and forth. Fearful of what would happen next, Pham said she began recording and Myers is seen yelling several racial slurs and threats. Jan Myers is facing hate crime charges for alleged racially charged threats against her Vietnamese American neighbor Thi Pham\u00a0 (King County Sheriff's Office) In the video, Myers is heard calling Pham \"slant eye\" and \"Miss Vietnam\" and threatening \"you\u2019re not going to live very long.\" Pham called police afterward. Two weeks prior, Pham said Myers had walked onto her patio naked from the waist down making obscene gestures in front of her two-year-old son. Myers was charged with a hate crime in April 2021, but a judge released her without bail on her own recognizance shortly after. Pham and her husband, Bill Healy, filed a civil lawsuit in King County Superior Court in August 2021, claiming Myers violated a no contact order and continued to harass them. The couple alleged that Myers screamed at them outside and drove her car straight at Healy. Attorneys for Pham and Healy announced the civil settlement at a press conference Thursday. \"I am happy that I can safely live in my home without racial harassment,\" Pham said, according to KING-TV. \"We hope Jan Myers follow through the agreement and move quickly.\" \"That was what made it very difficult, is when I realized my wife and my family, their physical well-being and their life was being threatened by this person,\" Healy said, according to KIRO.

The next hearing in the criminal case is set for April 25. Myers\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin on June 8.

Scripts are assembled on the coffee table in front of her; pen in hand, she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s making some last-minute notes. The city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bustling streets make a faint hum outside her hotel suite windows overlooking New York\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s iconic Central Park, but she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s too busy to notice \u201a\u00c4\u00ec she has work to do. In just a matter of days, she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll take the stage for what she says is the most important role of her career: as Roxie Hart in Bob Fosse\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s musical \u201a\u00c4\u00faChicago.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just threw myself into rehearsals,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she told CNN. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd it was six, seven, maybe eight hours a day. I was doing four hours of dance, one hour voice, two hours of acting \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 Then I came to New York and got thrown right into it with David Bushman and the director. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m doing this, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m doing this!\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s incredible because I didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t realize \u201a\u00c4\u00ec obviously, your voice, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a muscle, and so every day my voice is getting stronger and stronger to the point where I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just looking behind me going, who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s singing like that?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Anderson says she was first approached about the role 11 years ago the timing wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t right. Raising her kids without the help of a nanny, she said she didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to leave her two sons. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even imagine that was something I could do,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faEspecially with young kids. My kids were early teens at that time.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But she says the stars aligned when she got the call from acclaimed Broadway producer Barry Weissler just a few months ago. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll step onto the stage for the first time in the iconic role on Tuesday at the Ambassador Theater. Anderson, who was born and raised in the small Canadian town of Ladysmith, got her start in Hollywood as a model and went on to become one of the most recognizable Playboy stars, having landed her first cover on the magazine in 1989. She made her acting debut in ABC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faHome Improvement,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but then landed the role that made her a household name: C.J. Parker on \u201a\u00c4\u00faBaywatch,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 which she starred on for five seasons until 1997. Over the course of her career she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s had countless television roles and in 1996 a leading film role in \u201a\u00c4\u00faBarb Wire.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But when it comes to the stage, this is a first. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m gonna be so nervous,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she smiles. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut I also love the live audience. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done a little bit of public speaking like at Oxford and Cambridge about veganism and things like that \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 so I think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m really going to love it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Anderson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name has been in the zeitgeist of conversation in recent months, with the recent streaming series regarding an infamous videotape and everyone waiting for her to break her silence. But she has yet to address it publicly. Instead, she says, she made the purposeful decision to return to the spotlight with her craft. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI was just on my little ranch in Canada with my dogs and my gardens and everything. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been a long time since I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done anything, but I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve never done anything at this level.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Anderson then stands up and walks to two adjacent closets filled with designer clothing. She begins holding up dresses, jackets and blouses that all look a bit familiar. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because they are. Anderson shipped her most iconic looks from the 90s to wear in New York. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI never shop,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she says, holding a Chanel jacket. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is all from stuff that I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve had for forever. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m only shopping in my closet,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she laughs. Anderson says the preparation for \u201a\u00c4\u00faChicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 has been all-encompassing \u201a\u00c4\u00ec she even finds herself waking up in the middle of the night, reciting her monologue. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m dreaming and I wake up and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just talking. And then I go, okay, that was interesting. I go back to sleep and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s just like, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m dancing in my mind,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not a dancer. So I had to kind of put all this together. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even know how I did it. The show is very physical. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m doing the original choreography, which I think doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always happen. So they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re giving me everything and you get one thing and they give you more. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2No! I just learned this. Now there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a whole exit dance?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 My head, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to explode. But I do it. And then I get it. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Okay, I got this.\u201a\u00c4\u00f2\u201a\u00c4\u00fas After about 30 minutes responding to questions, Anderson trails off, staring at a towering pile of papers on the other side of her sprawling hotel suite. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s her long-awaited memoir. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also doing a documentary with Netflix. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen I was a lot younger, I took my power back in certain situations, and it feels the same way [now],\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt feels like another step closer to taking my power back and really taking it back. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s very empowering. And it does feel I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m being supported. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m being rooted for, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a new feeling for me. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to let anybody down, but I also really don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to let myself down.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 As for all of the recent attention she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s getting, she says she believes this Broadway role \u201a\u00c4\u00famight be the beginning of something really interesting for me.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd in a way where I feel respected, honored, all those weird things that I never felt before. So it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a very strange feeling \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I always knew, even as a young girl, I remember at five years old thinking that I was going to do something that was going to be unexpected. \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 not to prove people wrong, but just to prove to myself that I was much more capable of something great.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. FIRST ON FOX: A violent career criminal allegedly slashed a stranger in the face on the subway Sunday after he was released without bail for a similar attack on a woman in Brooklyn, Fox News Digital has learned. Brendan Dowling, 40, allegedly walked up to a 41-year-old man sitting on the J train and sliced open his face at about 8:30 a.m. March 6, as the subway car neared the Lower East Side station. NYC SUBWAY ATTACKS: MAN SHOT, WOMAN SEXUALLY ABUSED, AS POLICE HUNT SUSPECT WHO ASSAULTED VICTIM WITH HUMAN FECES It was Dowling's sixth arrest since he was released without bail in October after pleading guilty to attempted assault for slashing a woman in the head in Dec. 2020 in downtown Brooklyn, according to police and prosecutors. It wasn't immediately clear why he was sprung from jail on the Brooklyn case, but he faces a mandatory minimum of 3 \u00bd years in prison when he's sentenced, court records show. At Dowling's arraignment Monday in Manhattan criminal court, he was ordered held on $50,000 cash over $100,000 bond on charges of first-degree attempted assault and second-degree assault. Manhattan prosecutors said they were probing whether the slashing was motivated by anti-Asian bias. It was the latest in a string of vicious assaults on straphangers. NYC POLICE REPORT 6 SUBWAY STABBINGS, 2 ATTACKS WITH HATCHET, PIPE AS ZERO TOLERANCE PLAN TAKES EFFECT Transit crimes surged 184% from Feb. 28 to March 6 compared to the same period in 2021, according to newly released data from New York Police Department. In the prior week, subway crime had surged 205% compared to the same period in 2021. Fox News Digital was the first to report that anti-Asian hate crime complaints had skyrocketed by a staggering 343% from 2020 to 2021. Denzel Hodge was arrested for stabbing subway riders in separate incidents. (DCPI) Another man, Denzel Hodge, was nabbed March 4 in Brooklyn and held without bail for allegedly stabbing two subway riders in separate incidents and assaulting a third person. He is accused of plunging a knife into the back of a 77-year-old woman at about 8:10 a.m. March 1 in Cypress Hills Brooklyn in an unprovoked attack. Last month, he allegedly punched a 20-year-old woman in the head then stabbed her repeatedly in the stomach at a different Brooklyn subway station. NYC MAN CHARGED IN SUBWAY HAMMER ATTACK HAS RAP SHEET DATING BACK DECADES Last weekend at least seven straphangers were assaulted, including a man who narrowly escaped an assailant swinging an ax, according to the New York Post. The spike in subway violence comes after Mayor Eric Adams launched a program on Feb. 21 to remove the mentally ill and homeless from the transit system and connect them with services. During a press conference announcing the Subway Safety Plan, he acknowledged that many New Yorkers no longer feel safe on the subway.

On whether this was a symbolic show of support, a Royal source indicated it was unlikely to be accidental. The 95-year-old monarch was pictured smiling warmly at the Canadian PM as he held her right hand in both of his. Justin Trudeau was visiting for talks with the UK PM about the Ukraine war. The monarch, who is also Queen of Canada, tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 February and has carried out only \"light duties\" since then, cancelling several events. She carried out her first virtual engagements on 1 March before Monday's face-to-face meeting. During the audience at Windsor Castle's Oak Room, Mr Trudeau was also pictured laughing as the Queen gestured towards herself. The Queen was not seen with the walking stick which she has been using recently. Asked later at a Downing Street news conference about his meeting with the monarch, Mr Trudeau said: \"She was as insightful and perspicacious as ever, very interested in what is going on, asked me all sorts of questions about Canada. \"We had a really useful - for me anyway - conversation about global events, as we always do.\" As well as this gesture of support for Ukraine at the meeting, the Queen previously made a donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal to help people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. She has two high-profile events scheduled in the coming weeks: the Commonwealth Service on 14 March and the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service on 29 March, both at Westminster Abbey.

The shooting took place Monday on the grounds of East High School, though not within the school building. Gunshots were fired by multiple shooters from multiple vehicles, police said.

All three were rushed to hospitals. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile this incident occurred outside of a school, it could have occurred in any one of our neighborhoods,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Des Moines police said on Facebook. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe school is where the suspects found their target. The rapid response by DMPD officers, and the swift action by the school staff placing the building in lockdown and sheltering students and staff in place, certainly had a positive impact on safety and scene management.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 East High School Student Kaylie Shannon told CNN affiliate KCCI that she was in a car outside the school when she heard shots. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI was just sitting in my friend\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s car and then all of the sudden I heard 11 gunshots and some boys screaming,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shannon said. The school went under lockdown for more than 40 minutes, but students were dismissed around 3:30 p.m. when police gave an all clear, according to a statement from Des Moines Public Schools. Sgt. Paul Parizek called the incident \u201a\u00c4\u00faa punch in the gut,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 KCCI reported. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe kids in that school are our community\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most precious cargo,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. East High School was closed Tuesday, the statement from Des Moines Public Schools said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe DMPS grief team will be available at East High for students and staff beginning tomorrow through the remainder of the week. School counselors will be available at our other schools for students who need additional support,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the district said in a news release. 1 teen is dead and 2 are in critical condition after shooting \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think we can all agree an event like this is everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s worst nightmare. Tonight, hug your students and love them,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Principal Jill Versteeg said in the statement. Shootings in and near schools have become too common, Superintendent Thomas Ahart said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur staff and students are forced to train for these incidents and the trauma associated with the repeated drills and incidents will remain with them for years to come. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unfortunate that our state and our country have become a place where firearms are far too easily accessible. We remain committed to protecting our students and staff, but real change to gun laws and access would go a long way to help us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ahart said in the statement. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) of Kansas City went to the scene to assist in the investigation, the agency tweeted. Other agencies assisting with the investigation include the Iowa State Patrol, Polk County Sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office, the FBI and the Des Moines Public Schools Department of Public Safety.

The eldest Biden grandchild, 28, and her fianc\u00e9, Peter Neal, 24, will celebrate at perhaps the most exclusive venue in the US. Ms Biden said she was \"endlessly grateful\" to her \"Nana and Pop\" for the honour. Four other wedding receptions have ever been held at the presidential home. Ms Biden, a graduate of Columbia Law School and the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, announced her engagement to Mr Neal, a law student at the University of Pennsylvania, in September. Ms Biden will only be the fifth bride to have a White House wedding reception, to be held in November. The previous one took place in 2008, when Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former president George W Bush, celebrated a month after she was wed in Texas. It has actually been more common to hold wedding ceremonies themselves at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - there have been 18 in total. Since the first White House wedding in 1812 - between the sister of First Lady Dolley Madison and Thomas Todd - most have involved close family members of the first couple. The wedding of Nellie Grant, daughter of President Ulysses S Grant, in May 1874, was seen as the most elaborate event ever held at the White House at the time. Two hundred and fifty guests gathered in the East Room, decorated with masses of white flowers and Nellie's white satin dress fell into a six-foot train. Still, like many weddings, it was also a stressful affair. Mr and Mrs Grant were said to be concerned about their 19-year-old daughter's wedding to Algernon Sartoris, a diplomat. One sitting president has said \"I do\" at the White House: President Grover Cleveland wed Frances Folson in the Blue Room in June 1886. Other recent White House weddings have included those of Lynda Bird Johnson - daughter of President Lyndon Johnson - who married Charles Spittal Robb in a grand event in the East Room in 1967. In 1971, Tricia Nixon - daughter of President Richard Nixon and Pat Nixon, was the first to hold a wedding in the White House Rose Garden. The latest White House wedding, in 2013, was one of just three not involving family of the president. Pete Souza, who was chief White House photographer under President Barack Obama, married fianc\u00e9e Pattie Lease in the Rose Garden.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The pioneering procedure was done to save his life, but could also revolutionise the field of organ transplantation, they hope. The donated thymus tissue should help stop his body rejecting the new heart. Months on from the surgery, tests reveal Easton is progressing well. The thymus tissue is working, meaning his body is building critical immune cells which might ultimately reduce or even eliminate the need for him to take lifelong anti-rejection drugs. One of his doctors, Joseph Turek from Duke University Hospital, said: \"We are very excited about it. This concept of tolerance has always been the holy grail in transplantation, and we are now on the doorstep. \"This has the potential to change the face of solid organ transplantation in the future.\" The thymus gland helps the development of T-cells, which fight foreign substances in the body. It teaches these immune cells what is \"self\" and what isn't, and therefore what can be attacked. Giving Easton cultured thymus tissue from the same donor who gave him a heart, should help his body adopt the new tissues, his doctors believe. Easton was born with a weak heart as well as problems with his immune system. He spent his first seven months in hospital - some of it on life support - and needed numerous heart operations. as well as treatment for recurrent infections that his body was unable to fight on its own. His mother, Kaitlyn Sinnamon, recalls: \"It helped some, but it was basically a band aid for us to make it through transplant.\" His doctors applied to the medical regulatory body, the FDA, to carry out an experimental type of transplant that hadn't been done in combination before, as far as they knew. Since Easton needed a new heart and, independently, a new thymus gland, the FDA granted approval for the procedures that went ahead in August 2021, when Easton was six months old. Dr Turek said: \"This was very serendipitous. We had the expertise to do both. \"The work we had done in the laboratory was based around using thymus along with heart transplantation in order to develop tolerance - so basically retraining the immune system and having the thymus of the same donor and heart grow up together. \"We thought this was an opportunity for Easton. This could be applied to all solid organs down the road potentially if this works.\" Much more research is needed before then, including checking if it is viable to remove and replace the thymus in people who have one that is already fully functioning. The medical team plan to wean Easton off the immunosuppressive drugs at some point, to see how he progresses. Kaitlyn said: \"I hope that as he gets older he gets to be proud of his scars, and know that he not only got to save his own life, but got to save other people's lives as well.\" US man gets pig heart in world-first transplant Pig kidney transplanted into brain-dead person Duke Health\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

The Oxford indie group's song spent 59 weeks on its slow ascent to the summit of the Billboard Hot 100. The previous record was held by Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, on 35 weeks. \"I absolutely can't believe it,\" singer Dave Bayley said. \"For it to do this means the absolute world.\" He added in a Twitter message to fans: \"This song came out at the beginning of the pandemic and we didn't think it would really go anywhere because of that, and it has because you guys have embraced it so much.\" There are slow-burning hits, then there's Heat Waves - a song that took longer to reach room temperature than an ice age mammoth. The song's 59-week trek to the top of the US Billboard chart eclipses the previous record-holder, Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, by a massive 24 weeks. With just one song, Glass Animals have spent 27 more weeks on the chart than The Prodigy have managed in their entire career. The Oxford band also became the first UK group to break into Spotify's global top 10 since Clean Bandit in 2018 (Coldplay have since made the chart, too). The song had all the right ingredients for a sleeper hit. Glass Animals were well respected in the industry, with a Mercury Prize nomination for their second album How To Be A Human Being - but they weren't big enough to have their song automatically added to radio station and streaming service playlists. It took months for Heat Waves to cross over from alternative radio to pop stations, building up a bigger head of steam as it went. Streaming also played a crucial part in its success. Songs tend to have a longer half-life now than 10 years ago, as fans continue to play their favourite tracks, keeping them afloat for months on end. Glass Animals were also given a late boost by TikTok, where creator Juliette Cullen used Heat Waves to soundtrack a viral video about a lack of curly fries in certain branches of McDonald's. The band have joked its success is all down to Bayley's mum streaming it on a loop\u2026 but given that the song's been played 1.3 billion times on Spotify alone, she'd had to have started 9,900 years ago. In reality, it's just a great song - one whose vibey production and low-key hooks reveal new treasures on each listen. Hopefully its success will encourage people to seek out the rest of the band's equally-rewarding back catalogue. The song, which was originally released as a single in June 2020, first snuck into the US singles chart in 100th place in January 2021. Allow YouTube content?

A New Jersey man has been sentenced to 375 years in jail in the 2016 killing of three people, including two children, and attempted murder of three more after authorities say he became enraged over a Facebook post. Jeremy Arrington, 31, was convicted last month in Essex County of three counts of murder and attempted murder as well as burglary, criminal restraint and weapons charges.

Andy Beshear has vetoed a bill that contains elements of an \u201a\u00c4\u00faanti-critical race theory\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 bill that he says \u201a\u00c4\u00fatries to police classroom discussions on topics such as race.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beshear vetoed the bill with a veto letter saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00faSenate Bill 1 tries to police classroom discussions on topics such as race. These are discussions our children are having with or without adults in our schools. Prescribing a rigid approach to what must be \u201a\u00c4\u00f2taught\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 in those discussions will lessen if not erase them.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 SB1 states in part that public schools shall provide instructions that align with certain concepts including: \u201a\u00c4\u00faAn individual, by virtue of the individual\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed by other members of the same race or sex;\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe understanding that the institution of slavery and post-Civil War laws enforcing racial segregation and discrimination were contrary to the fundamental American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, but that defining racial disparities solely on the legacy of this institution is destructive to the unification of our nation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In his letter, Beshear said that children and adults must be able to exercise their First Amendment rights and have important discussions free of government censorship. The bill received final passage from the state Senate last month, according to the Kentucky General Assembly page on SB 1. Kentucky's Democratic governor vetoes anti-trans sports ban Although the legislation does not implicitly use the term critical race theory, the bill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s language shares similarities with other measures passed in Republican-controlled states. Samuel Crankshaw, communications manager for the ACLU of Kentucky, said Wednesday that SB 1 is \u201a\u00c4\u00fapart of a nationwide strategy to whitewash history, perpetuate white supremacy, and erase marginalized people \u201a\u00c4\u00ec particularly people of color and LGBTQ people. They would also deny educators and students their First Amendment right to free speech.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beshear notes that the bill would require teachers to incorporate \u201a\u00c4\u00faa specific set of historical documents and speeches\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 into lectures. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThese texts were not selected by historians or scholars, but by a political body.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 One of the required texts is Ronald Reagan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 1964 political campaign speech \u201a\u00c4\u00faA Time For Choosing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beshear said. \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe fact that this text is included over others like Dwight Eisenhower\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement to troops in advance of the D-Day invasion suggests the bill is aimed more at politics than at history.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The House passed the current version of the bill with a vote of 67-29 and the Senate passed the bill 21-15-1. A majority vote by members of both houses can override a governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s veto, according to the Kentucky General Assembly legislative process page.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The group hope to be the first all-black team to climb Mount Everest. The other nine members of the team are Americans. About 6,000 climbers are known to have conquered Everest to date, but fewer than 10 people of African origin are in this exclusive group. The Full Circle Everest team hopes to more than double that number. They have just left base camp and hope to reach the summit in about two months. At 62, Mr Kagambi is the oldest in the team of experienced mountaineers. He has summitted all the highest peaks in Africa, as well as the highest point in four continents, and hopes to become the first African to achieve all seven. He was the first black African to conquer Denali -  the highest peak in North America. \"The main goal of our expedition is to encourage people of colour to go out, to venture into the mountains, so that it's not just white people out there. It is also to show people that they can do it, because there are people who they feel like this is not for us [black people], it is for them,\" he told the BBC before leaving for Nepal. Although many Nepalese and Indians have climbed Everest - often as guides, mountaineering is often seen as a white person's sport, especially in the West - something that Mr Kagambi grapples with in the US as a mountaineering instructor and guide. It comes in the form of clients who don't trust in his skill because of his ethnicity. \"Before people realise what I have done, especially when I meet white people in the US, you see some people hesitating. Until you prove to them that you know what you are doing - that's when they open up. I see that quite a bit,\" he said. The former primary school teacher fell in love with mountains in 1973 when as a teenager he watched in awe from his village at the midnight fireworks on the peak of Mount Kenya as the country celebrated its first decade of independence from British colonial rule. \"That was really unique and I remember saying: 'I wish I can do that.' But I never thought I would.\" Years later, after graduating from a teachers' training college, he made an attempt on Mount Kenya and reached the summit. \"The first time I stepped on the snow, I knew that it's something I really loved doing. And I kept going back and liking it more,\" he said. But his path to scaling Everest has been the steepest. On two previous attempts, being Kenyan was his undoing after American sponsors insisted that beneficiaries must be US residents. \"The last one was very close - like four months before the expedition - that's when I was struck off. That was frustrating but rules have to be followed,\" he said - a glimpse of the stoicism learnt from the mountains and which pervades his speech. Climbing Everest isn't cheap - up to $85,000 (\u00a365,000) - and he had given up trying because age was catching up with him. Then an email in January 2021 from his American friend and fellow mountaineer Philip Henderson changed everything. \"My immediate reaction was that I wouldn't do it. I told him that I'm too old and my knees are already not good on the mountains.\" But Mr Henderson insisted, pointing to reviews from other mountaineers who hailed Mr Kagambi as a guide who was \"encouraging and supportive, especially to women\". Getting admission into the team was the easiest hurdle. Finding sponsors proved the most difficult obstacle, as the traditional way of knocking on corporate doors proved futile. \"The hardest part for me was that I expected to work towards going to Everest in terms of training but I didn't have the facilities and the finance to do that.\" Frustrated, out of funds and with no sponsorship, a breakthrough came through a WhatsApp group of his friends who were raising funds for the expedition. Contributions were trickling in slowly and there was little hope in sight. Then word reached a Kenyan betting firm, which immediately offered a sponsorship deal, which covers Mr Kagambi's training, travel allowance, insurance and operational logistics. Part of his rigorous training regime has included scaling Mount Kenya six times from January to April. That was followed by a two-week expedition on the Rwenzori mountains in neighbouring Uganda. The Full Circle Everest team also met in January for a reconnaissance and team-building session in Nepal. Earlier, from July to December last year he was in the US and carrying 50kg bags while hiking for months and training students. \"I've been on the mountain all the time. Because of my knees, the best thing for me is to be out there hiking as high as I can for training,\" he said. His family is worried about his wellbeing, especially because climbing Mount Everest is such a dangerous undertaking. \"I really hope it goes well because at this point we know there are only two outcomes - it's either he goes and comes back, or he goes and doesn't come back. There's that anxiety, there's that fear, but we don't want to show him,\" his daughter Cynthia said. But Mr Kagambi seems unfazed and defiantly declared that he had done riskier things in his life. He also pointed to his long experience of navigating through snow, glaciers, ice and rocks. \"I'm confident of summitting Mount Everest, but the other thing I say is - I will not put my life at risk to do it. I have done enough mountaineering to know my body. I can assess and tell myself it's time to go back,\" he said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The eldest Biden grandchild, 28, and her fianc\u00e9, Peter Neal, 24, will celebrate at perhaps the most exclusive venue in the US. Ms Biden said she was \"endlessly grateful\" to her \"Nana and Pop\" for the honour. Four other wedding receptions have ever been held at the presidential home. Ms Biden, a graduate of Columbia Law School and the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, announced her engagement to Mr Neal, a law student at the University of Pennsylvania, in September. Ms Biden will only be the fifth bride to have a White House wedding reception, to be held in November. The previous one took place in 2008, when Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former president George W Bush, celebrated a month after she was wed in Texas. It has actually been more common to hold wedding ceremonies themselves at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - there have been 18 in total. Since the first White House wedding in 1812 - between the sister of First Lady Dolley Madison and Thomas Todd - most have involved close family members of the first couple. The wedding of Nellie Grant, daughter of President Ulysses S Grant, in May 1874, was seen as the most elaborate event ever held at the White House at the time. Two hundred and fifty guests gathered in the East Room, decorated with masses of white flowers and Nellie's white satin dress fell into a six-foot train. Still, like many weddings, it was also a stressful affair. Mr and Mrs Grant were said to be concerned about their 19-year-old daughter's wedding to Algernon Sartoris, a diplomat. One sitting president has said \"I do\" at the White House: President Grover Cleveland wed Frances Folson in the Blue Room in June 1886. Other recent White House weddings have included those of Lynda Bird Johnson - daughter of President Lyndon Johnson - who married Charles Spittal Robb in a grand event in the East Room in 1967. In 1971, Tricia Nixon - daughter of President Richard Nixon and Pat Nixon, was the first to hold a wedding in the White House Rose Garden. The latest White House wedding, in 2013, was one of just three not involving family of the president.

The five-figure penalties on the two flyers accused of violence are part of $2m (\u00a31.5m) in fines levied this year. US airlines have seen record numbers of disruptive passengers since early 2021, with many incidents involving the refusal to wear an anti-viral facemask. The fines were announced by transport secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday. \"If you are on an airplane, don't be a jerk and don't endanger the flight crews and fellow passengers,\" he said in an appearance on ABC's The View. \"If you do, you will be fined by the FAA.\" In one incident, an American Airlines passenger travelling from Texas to North Carolina has been asked to pay a $81,950 fine for threatening to hurt a flight attendant. The attendant had offered to help the passenger after she fell into the aisle of the plane. The unnamed passenger then allegedly pushed an airline worker and tried to open the cabin door. While flight attendants attempted to restrain her, she repeatedly hit one staff member in the head. When she was placed in cuffs, \"she spit at, headbutted, bit and tried to kick the crew and other passengers\", the FAA said in a news release. In the other incident, the passenger was flying on Delta Air Lines from Las Vegas to Atlanta. She allegedly tried to \"hug and kiss the passenger seated next to her, walked to the front of the aircraft to try to exit during flight; refused to return to her seat; and bit another passenger multiple times\". That passenger, who is also unnamed, was physically restrained by crew members and has now been asked to pay a fine of $77,272. Neither incident involved a failure to adhere to Covid measures. In his interview with The View, Mr Buttigieg said the US would decide by 18 April on whether to extend the federal requirement to wear masks on planes and in airports. The FAA announced a \"zero-tolerance\" policy on unruly passengers in January 2021, and has issued some $7m in fines since then. They have recorded 7,060 air rage incidents and say around 70% involved masking rules. But the rate of incidents has now declined by 60% since its high last year.

The pioneering procedure was done to save his life, but could also revolutionise the field of organ transplantation, they hope. The donated thymus tissue should help stop his body rejecting the new heart. Months on from the surgery, tests reveal Easton is progressing well. The thymus tissue is working, meaning his body is building critical immune cells which might ultimately reduce or even eliminate the need for him to take lifelong anti-rejection drugs. One of his doctors, Joseph Turek from Duke University Hospital, said: \"We are very excited about it. This concept of tolerance has always been the holy grail in transplantation, and we are now on the doorstep. \"This has the potential to change the face of solid organ transplantation in the future.\" The thymus gland helps the development of T-cells, which fight foreign substances in the body. It teaches these immune cells what is \"self\" and what isn't, and therefore what can be attacked. Giving Easton cultured thymus tissue from the same donor who gave him a heart, should help his body adopt the new tissues, his doctors believe. Easton was born with a weak heart as well as problems with his immune system. He spent his first seven months in hospital - some of it on life support - and needed numerous heart operations. as well as treatment for recurrent infections that his body was unable to fight on its own. His mother, Kaitlyn Sinnamon, recalls: \"It helped some, but it was basically a band aid for us to make it through transplant.\" His doctors applied to the medical regulatory body, the FDA, to carry out an experimental type of transplant that hadn't been done in combination before, as far as they knew. Since Easton needed a new heart and, independently, a new thymus gland, the FDA granted approval for the procedures that went ahead in August 2021, when Easton was six months old. Dr Turek said: \"This was very serendipitous. We had the expertise to do both. \"The work we had done in the laboratory was based around using thymus along with heart transplantation in order to develop tolerance - so basically retraining the immune system and having the thymus of the same donor and heart grow up together. \"We thought this was an opportunity for Easton. This could be applied to all solid organs down the road potentially if this works.\" Much more research is needed before then, including checking if it is viable to remove and replace the thymus in people who have one that is already fully functioning. The medical team plan to wean Easton off the immunosuppressive drugs at some point, to see how he progresses. Kaitlyn said: \"I hope that as he gets older he gets to be proud of his scars, and know that he not only got to save his own life, but got to save other people's lives as well.\" US man gets pig heart in world-first transplant Pig kidney transplanted into brain-dead person Duke Health\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, Brandon Caserta, 33, and Barry Croft, 46, each faced a kidnapping conspiracy charge. Mr Harris and Mr Caserta were found not guilty, but the charges against Mr Fox and Mr Croft ended in mistrial. The government had argued they targeted Gretchen Whitmer, 50, in a 2020 plot. Jurors began deliberating this week after 14 days of testimony and had indicated earlier on Friday that they were deadlocked on some of the charges. They ultimately reached no verdict against Mr Fox,  who was alleged to be the group's ringleader, and Mr Croft, both of whom were also facing an additional count each of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. In a statement sent by her office on Friday, Governor Whitmer thanked prosecutors and law enforcement for their work on the case and warned that \"Michiganders and Americans - especially our children - are living through the normalisation of political violence\". According to secret chats and private conversations revealed in court, members of the group - some of whom were said to be militia members - viewed Ms Whitmer as a \"tyrant\". Prosecutors said the men planned to abduct her from her holiday home, conduct some kind of \"treason trial\" and set her adrift in a boat on Lake Michigan. But lawyers for the accused countered that the scheme was mostly \"smoke and mirrors\", profane talk by angry and disillusioned men. Throughout the trial, they maintained that the men had been entrapped - or improperly induced into the crime - by an undercover FBI operation. The FBI has said it began tracking the group's movements after spotting online discussions of political violence. According to an FBI affidavit, an undercover source attended a June 2020 meeting in Ohio, where a group of Michigan-based militia members discussed overthrowing state governments \"that they believed were violating the US Constitution\". That October, the bureau announced the arrests of 13 alleged plotters. On the witness stand, two of the men - Ty Garbin, 26, and Kaleb Franks, 27 - said the participants acted of their own volition and were free to leave the group whenever they wanted. Both men had taken plea deals to avoid a prison sentence. FBI agent Timothy \"Red\" Bates also took the stand, testifying that the group discussed blowing up bridges near the governor's house to thwart law enforcement. But the defence alleged an FBI informant named Daniel \"Big Dan\" Chappel who infiltrated the group acted as a \"double agent\", befriending and radicalising the men to advance the plot. Mr Harris - the only defendant of the four to take the stand - slammed Big Dan as \"a liar\" who \"got scared by memes\" shared within the group. Mr Fox's lawyer also attacked Big Dan for \"[beating] the drum and [getting] them all worked up\".\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Sherri Papini vanished in November 2016, launching a massive search, only for the Northern California mother of two to turn up three weeks later, telling investigators she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d been kidnapped, beaten and branded. California woman accused of hoax kidnapping was driven by 'narcissistic behavior,' sheriff says The Justice Department says Papini made the whole thing up. She was arrested last Thursday and has been charged with making false statements to a law enforcement officer and mail fraud, the department said in a news release. Papini, who had been detained since her arrest, appeared before a judge via Zoom on Tuesday. US Magistrate Judge Jeremy Peterson ruled she could be released on an $120,000 bond, with certain conditions, including that her travel be limited to only one part of California, that she must receive psychiatric treatment, must surrender her passport and cannot use firearms, among other terms. The judge addressed Papini directly, warning her that if she violated those conditions, there would be further penalties. Assistant US Attorney Veronica Alegria argued against Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s release, claiming Papini is an \u201a\u00c4\u00faextreme flight risk\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and has a \u201a\u00c4\u00falengthy pattern of dishonesty.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s alleged fraudulent disappearance was not without consequences to others: It cost upward of $230,000 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facountless hours\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of manpower, according to officials. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUltimately, the investigation revealed that there was no kidnapping,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 US Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said in the DOJ news release, \u201a\u00c4\u00faand that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted based on the defendant\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conduct.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out multiples times to Michael Borges, an attorney for Papini, for comment. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s virtual court appearance, Borges said his client has no intention to flee while she awaits trial. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s husband reported her missing November 2, 2016, after she failed to pick up her kids at day care. She was found three weeks later, alone on Interstate 5 about 140 miles from home. She told police she had been kidnapped by two women who wore masks and spoke Spanish. They held her at gunpoint, she said, kept her chained in a closet and branded her. But last week, the Justice Department said Papini was actually with an ex-boyfriend in Southern California and that she caused her own injuries in support of her abduction claim. In all, the cost of the investigation borne by public safety agencies was around $150,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a conservative estimate, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said in a statement on Facebook last week. But the cost isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t only measured in dollars, Johnson said. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case and her story diverted resources from real cases with real victims. Years ago, she told police she had been abducted, beaten and branded. Now she's charged with making it all up \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the sheriff said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faFinally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faall of law enforcement in Shasta (County) was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling (of) this case.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case cost the public in other ways, too. According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, between 2017 and 2021, Papini received $30,000 from the California Victim Compensation Board, which assists and reimburses victims of violent crimes for \u201a\u00c4\u00facrime-related expenses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 they suffer. In Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case, the affidavit says, $1,000 was used so Papini could buy blinds for her home and nearly $2,000 were paid to the ambulance provider who transported Papini after she was found. The rest of the money were payments for Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s therapy and treatment for anxiety and post-traumatic stress stemming from her supposed kidnapping. Then, there was the GoFundMe campaign that allegedly netted just over $49,000. Per the affidavit, donors were told the funds would be used to \u201a\u00c4\u00fafind and bring Sherri home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In fact, federal prosecutors say, more than $30,000 was withdrawn by a family member from the campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bank account and more than $11,000 was used to pay off the family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s personal credit cards. The remaining amount was \u201a\u00c4\u00faspent on personal expenses,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the affidavit says. A GoFundMe spokesperson told CNN the fundraiser has been removed from the platform and has not been actively receiving donations since 2016. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with law enforcement to assist with their ongoing investigation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the spokesperson said. Regarding the GoFundMe campaign, family spokesman Chris Thomas referred questions to Borges, the attorney for Papini. Last week, Thomas criticized Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s arrest, which the spokesperson said happened in front of her children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf requested, Sherri would have fully complied and come to the police station,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faas she has done multiple times before, where this could have been handled in a more appropriate way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini and her husband \u201a\u00c4\u00facooperated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with law enforcement, Thomas said, adding, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are confused by several aspects of the charges and hope to get clarification in the coming days.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Taylor Romine contributed to this report.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

It has shown us both the risks, and, more inspiringly, what it means to really care for democracy. In a war they didn't choose, Ukrainians are fighting, and dying, for the right to free elections, to the rule of law, and an impartial media, for the right to be a democratic country. Their bravery puts our laziness to shame.

He could not say how long the conflict would last, but insisted that Ukraine's defeat was not inevitable. Mr Blinken praised the \"extraordinary resilience\" of the Ukrainian people. \"If it's the intention of Moscow to try somehow to topple the government and install its own puppet regime, 45 million Ukrainians are going to reject that one way or the other,\" he said. The war has already not gone as Russian President Vladimir Putin might have planned, he added. Stiff resistance by Ukrainian forces continued to hamper Russian advances across the country on the ninth day of the invasion. In the south, Russian forces captured areas along the Black Sea coast, and the port city of Mariupol remained surrounded. But the governor of Mykolaiv said Russian troops had been driven out of the city. Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, in the north, also remained under siege.

He said the international community was committed to doing everything it could to help Ukraine and also to put \"excruciating pressure on Russia to end this war of choice that Vladimir Putin started\". Asked if he was convinced Ukraine could win, he said: \"Over time, absolutely.\" \"I can't tell you how long this will go on. I can't tell you how long it will take. But the idea that Russia can subjugate to its will 45 million people who are ardently fighting for their future and their freedom, that does not involve Russia having its thumb on Ukraine, that tells you a lot.\" Mr Blinken also said he was concerned about escalation. \"It's something we care about and are focused on because the only thing worse than a war which is contained to Ukraine is one that escalates even further and goes beyond it.\" He warned that Russian forces were using \"increasingly brutal\" methods against civilians in Ukraine, and that there had been tremendous human suffering as a result. \"We're seeing Russia go after critical infrastructure that's denying Ukrainians water, denying them electricity, denying them heat,\" he said. \"Those methods are, unfortunately, tragically, part of the Russian playbook under President Putin. And I think we're likely to see more of that.\" Asked if the US would seek a change in Moscow's leadership to bring an end to the invasion, he replied: \"We don't seek that, and in any event it's not up to us. The Russian people need to decide their leadership.\" \"What I would say to the Russian people is: How in the world is this war of aggression... advancing your interests, your needs?\" he added.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The families of Americans being held in Russia\u2019s custody say they remain hopeful that the ongoing Russian conflict will not stymie their efforts to bring their loved ones home unscathed, despite their fears of time running out. Three Americans have been detained by Russian authorities for amounts of time varying from months to years. Nonetheless, the families of Brittney Griner, Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan remain relentless in their pursuit for their safe returns. \"We\u2019ve got to get our son back before he dies, or they put more charges on him.\" Meanwhile, Russia has waged war on Ukraine for more than six weeks, since Kremlin forces first invaded the country on Feb. 24. Since then, at least 1,611 people have been killed and another 2,227 have been hurt, according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Loved ones of two of the three people spoke with Fox News Digital this week, as they said they will continue to ensure their voices are heard despite the constant Russia news coming out of Ukraine.

(Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images) Paul Whelan, now 52, worked in corporate security for about 10 years before his normal life disintegrated at the hands of the Russian government. His job involved him traveling to corporate locations to test the physical security of facilities his company worked with. He had traveled to Russia a half-dozen times from 2008 and 2018, but his connection to the country \"was really just as a tourist,\" his twin brother, Paul, told Fox News Digital. \"He wasn't there visiting any locations. He didn't work there. He just had made contacts with people who were in Russia,\" Whelan said. \"He happened to be in Russia, he happened to be in contact with those people, and his life fell apart.\" Paul Whelan, a former US marine accused of espionage and arrested in Russia in December 2018, stands inside a defendants' cage as he waits to hear his verdict in Moscow on June 15, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images) Paul, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran from Michigan, was in Russia to attend a wedding in December 2018 when he was arrested in Moscow. He was accused of espionage and convicted in June 2020, when a Russian court sentenced him to 16 years in prison. \"In hindsight, probably every American going to Russia in the last two or three years should have been worried about their personal security,\" Whelan said. JACK BARSKY: WHAT A RUSSIAN SPY'S JOB MIGHT LOOK LIKE NOW, FROM ONE OF THE KGB'S 'BEST-TRAINED' DOUBLE AGENTS Paul became known for his \"feisty\" personality and for his unwillingness to crumble to the Russian pressures and has maintained his innocence. In one iconic image from his trial, Whelan, now TKTK, held a white sign that read, among other phrases, \"Sham Trial!,\" \"No Human Rights! Paul\u2019s Life Matters!\" \"Decisive Action from POTUS and PMs Needed!\" and \"Happy Birthday Flora,\" his beloved dog. David Whelan said he last spoke to his brother in October 2018, but he and his siblings have remained steadfast in their efforts to bring Paul home safely. \"From the day that he was arrested on Dec. 28, 2018, for about 18 months until he was sent off to Mordovia to the labor colony, none of us were able to speak to him,\" Whelan said. Since around September 2020, Paul has been able to make near-daily calls to his parents and is also allowed to call the U.S. embassy. But there have been times that the family has suddenly lost contact with him, such as in June of this year, when he was \"sent to a hospital without requesting it.\" \"We have our own suspicions about why,\" David said, describing how it was \"just before a meeting between President Biden and President Putin. \"And then as soon as he came back from the hospital, he was put in solitary for a month,\" David went on. For that almost two-month period, he was unable to make phone calls to our parents.\" David said his brother has tried to be vocal even behind bars about conditions behind bars, \"and we\u2019ve tried to help him amplify his voice and presence.\" Whelan said his family has weekly meetings with the U.S. Embassy in Russia, and have continued to do so despite the complications that have arisen from the Russia-Ukraine War. He lauded the work and support of U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan and said the embassy forewarned the Whelan family early on about their concerns regarding Russia\u2019s impending invasion of Ukraine. \"The real issue for us was, if sanctions go into place, what does that do to impact the ability for us to flow money Paul \u2013 money that we get put on his phone card, money that we put in his prison account, so he can buy fresh fruits and vegetables,\" Whelan explained. \"As soon as we saw that these things were potentially coming, even though we didn't know the day that they would happen, we transferred as much money from his trust account as we could to the U.S. Embassy, and they very quickly tried to move that onto his accounts and were successful.\" US ambassador to Russia John Sullivan speaks with the media outside the Moscow City Court in Moscow on June 15, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images) David estimated his brother would have enough money in his inmate account to last him for the next few months. But he said he feared the impacts of any additional sanctions on his brother\u2019s situation and their ability to regularly check up on him. \"I think the biggest concerns right now are the ability for the U.S. Embassy to continue to operate in Moscow. It's a key ally for us to be able to support Paul,\" Whelan continued. \"If he can't communicate with us, can't receive mail or packages from us, then he really is isolated. He's an American citizen who doesn't speak Russian in a Russian labor colony. I think everybody can imagine how awful.\" Whelan said his brother is largely unaware of the ongoing conflict, as he is only exposed to Russian-sponsored television, if at all. Asked how he felt the war could stymie his family\u2019s and the government\u2019s efforts to bring Paul home safely, he said: \"It complicates things.\" \"I don't know that Paul's case is necessarily off the stove,\" he went on. \"It may just be on the back burner for a while.\" WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 30: \u00a0Joey Reed and Paula Reed, the parents of Trevor Reed, a U.S. Marine who is currently being detained in a Russian prison, demonstrate in Lafayette Park near the White House on March 30, 2022, in Washington, DC.\u00a0 (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Trevor Reed, a now-30-year-old U.S. Marine Corps. veteran and former presidential security guard, had been living in Russia for the summer of 2019 when was arrested by Russian police and accused of assaulting a police officer. He had been celebrating in a park with his longtime Russian girlfriend and her colleagues at the time, his father, Joey Reed, told Fox News Digital. \"He was extremely intoxicated because they\u2019d been to a party for her law firm in a park,\" he explained. \"Everyone knew him because he\u2019d been there all summer in and out of the office all day long.\" At the time, Reed had been taking Russian language classes for an international studies degree through the University of North Texas, his father said. \"He got sick. They stopped to let him get out \u2026 They\u2019re kind of corralling him and, one of the people called the police,\" Reed went on. \"From then on, everything else is a lie, based on witnesses, based on video, based on expert witnesses who examined what little evidence that Russians allowed in courtroom.\" Police officers escort US ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, into a courtroom prior to a hearing in Moscow on March 11, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by ALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP via Getty Images) Reed\u2019s girlfriend and her colleagues followed police, who had taken Reed into custody, to the police station, where they were told to return at 9 a.m. to pick him up after he had sobered up. \"He should have never gone to the police station under Russian law. He was supposed to have been taken to a hospital,\" Reed said. When the woman returned to the police station with her mother at 9 a.m., they were greeted by agents from the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). \"She was frantic,\" Reed said. The concerned parents called the U.S. Embassy and ultimately hired the best lawyers they could. Russian law enforcement accused Reed of drunkenly grabbing an officer\u2019s arm and elbowing another while inside a police car on the way to the station.

(Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) Within months, the Reeds\u2019 lawyers, including one who was a retired judge, told them: \"Something\u2019s not right here.\" Reed said he later heard from top government officials, \"We\u2019re being told from the top people of Moscow to keep the heaviest charges on him and make sure that he\u2019s convicted.\" At his arraignment, Reed told the judge: \"Your honor, I don't remember anything that happened. I would never intentionally try and hurt a police officer. All my friends are police officers.\" His father said. \"He said, \u2018If you can show me that I did this, I'll plead guilty \u2026 and beg for mercy from the court.\" Following a public trial, Reed was convicted in July 2020 of assaulting police officers and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Much like the Whelan family, the Reeds meet with the U.S. government once a week to discuss their son\u2019s case. Joey Reed said they work with people who are assigned to nothing but handling their son\u2019s case. He said they also speak with the Whelan family regularly. Alina Tsybulnik (C), girlfriend of US ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, reacts during verdict hearing at Moscow's Golovinsky district court on July 30, 2020. His time in Russian prisons and labor camps has been concerning, the family said. \"He was essentially in solitary confinement, I believe, for over a year in a pretty bad prison,\" Reed said. \"Once he got to the labor camp \u2026 they would wake him up every hour. You know, they were punishing him for different things.\" He added: \"My son saw the sun maybe a dozen times in two years.\" Trevor pushed back against Russian authorities\u2019 efforts to make him work at the labor camp, telling them: \"I\u2019m not working for you. You\u2019ve taken me hostage, and I\u2019m not going to make stuff for you to make money on.\" Absent of a stricter housing facility within the camp, authorities have begun to accuse Reed of false violations that land him in solitary confinement. US ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, stands inside a defendants' cage during his verdict hearing at Moscow's Golovinsky district court on July 30, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images) \"They send you to solitary confinement, basically because you're refusing to work. And they make up reasons for it. But the real reason is you're refusing to work,\" Reed said. \"So, my son spent the first seven months there, basically in solitary confinement for 14 to 21 days at a time, and then they let him out for two and then they put him back out on more false charges.\" Trevor is sporadically able to make phone calls and communicate with his girlfriend or the embassy, but the correspondence is irregular and infrequent, Reed said. \"Our only communications for 232 days were through his girlfriend and occasionally he would call his attorneys in Moscow,\" Reed went on. \"But they would not let him call the embassy or us.\" Authorities further claimed that Trevor did not have the necessary calling card, then didn\u2019t have enough money on the card to make calls, and then would only allow him to speak on the phone in Russian. Trevor\u2019s situation has grown recently concerning in recent months after he grew ill with active tuberculosis and then began continuously coughing up blood. Reed said Russian authorities have recently refused to re-test Reed for active tuberculosis, despite Russian-sponsored media reports that have claimed that they did so several times. He was hospitalized for 10 days before he was returned to the camp and placed in solitary confinement once again. \"He\u2019s been sick almost the whole time he's been there,\" Reed said. \"You're not supposed to be put in solitary confinement if you're sick or injured, and he's both.\" On March 28, Trevor began a hunger strike in protest of his condition, prompting his concerned parents to travel from their home in Texas to Washington, D.C. to further embark on their media campaign in support of their son. Four days after the hunger strike began, Trevor was back in a hospital, where he called his girlfriend and said he had lost seven pounds since it started. Despite that the hospital usually provides Reed with opportunities to make outgoing calls, Trevor\u2019s girlfriend has not heard from him since. On Thursday, the family posted on a Twitter account \"Free Trevor Reed,\" writing: \"To the Russian Govt: Please let us speak to our son so we know he is alive and his condition.\" Earlier this week, the family said they had not received proof that their son was alive in almost a week. \"Our son is out of time,\" the family wrote. \"We are urgently calling on the Russian government to provide proof-of-life and resume allowing Trevor to call us. Our son is critically ill \u2013 this is not the time for cruelty for cruelty\u2019s sake.\" Reed told Fox News Digital that Reed\u2019s condition is \"getting worse and worse and we\u2019re able to help less and less.\" \"We\u2019re just afraid that we\u2019ve got to get our son back before he dies or has more charges put on him,\" Reed said. \"He\u2019s innocent.\" Brittney Griner is pictured in an undated photo after her arrest.

She is believed to be detained in a facility near Moscow, U.S. State Department officials have said. At the time, Griner, a 31-year-old WNBA star with the Phoenix Mercury, \u00a0was trying to return to the U.S. during a break in the Russian league.

Griner\u2019s wife did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for an interview.

Eric Greitens alleged he was physically abusive toward his children and her, according to court documents filed Monday. Greitens resigned as governor in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct and has been trying to mount a political comeback in his pursuit of a US Senate seat. A number of his GOP primary rivals called on Monday for him to drop out of the race following the abuse allegations made by his ex-wife. Sheena Greitens, who now resides in Texas with the former couple\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s two children, said she grew so afraid of her former husband that she sought to limit his access to weapons and began sleeping in her children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s room out of concern for their safety, according to an affidavit filed in the Circuit Court of Boone County in Missouri, as part of her effort to have a custody case moved to Texas. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn early June 2018, I became afraid for my safety and that of our children at our home, which was fairly isolated, due to Eric\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unstable and coercive behavior,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, according to court records from the ongoing custody battle. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis behavior included physical violence toward our children, such as cuffing our then three-year-old son across the face at the dinner table in front of me and yanking him around by his hair.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sheena Greitens said she and others were so concerned about Eric Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 behavior that they limited his access to firearms on three occasions. She said she was concerned about the \u201a\u00c4\u00faescalation of physical violence\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and eventually, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI started sleeping in my children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s room simply to try to keep them safe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to her affidavit. In a statement, Eric Greitens denied the allegations. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBeing a father is the joy of my life and my single most important responsibility,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI will continue to love and care for my beautiful sons with all of my being, and that includes fighting for the truth and against completely fabricated, baseless allegations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, his attorney asked the judge to seal the custody case. In her affidavit, Sheena Greitens laid out a series of allegations of verbal threats and physical abuse against both her and their children. She detailed how Eric Greitens allegedly threatened to use his political ties to tarnish his ex-wife\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reputation. In one instance, she claimed Eric Greitens had \u201a\u00c4\u00faknocked me down and confiscated my cell phone, wallet, and keys so that I was unable to call for help or extricate myself and our children,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the court filing. In another 2019 incident, one of the children returned from a visit with Eric Greitens with a swollen face, bleeding gums and a loose tooth, according to her court filing. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said Dad had hit him; however, Eric said they were roughhousing and it had been an accident,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sheena Greitens said in her affidavit. At one point, Sheena Greitens said she tried to flee with the children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen I told Eric about my plans, he threatened to come to the airport and have me arrested for kidnapping and child abuse, saying that because of his authority as a former Governor who had supported law enforcement, the police would support him and not believe me, and I would lose our children,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the affidavit. Sheena and Eric Greitens divorced in 2020. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 campaign manager Dylan Johnson said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHis ex-wife is engaged in a last-ditch attempt to vindictively destroy her ex-husband. Though she knows that the press will viciously repeat her false allegations, Eric has always been a great Dad, who loves his boys and has always put them first, and that is why he is filing for full custody of his children.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In a Tuesday statement, Sheena Greitens stood by her sworn affidavit and said she would provide evidence and documentation if the court requests it. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMy only interest is what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best for my two children, and for the last four years, I have gone to great lengths to keep these family matters private to protect them,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in her statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI am not interested in litigating this matter anywhere other than the courtroom.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Eric Greitens has been vying for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Roy Blunt. The crowded primary also includes US Rep. Vicky Hartzler, State Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long and others. In the wake of the latest allegations, Hartzler, Schmitt and Long called on Greitens to drop out of the race. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have one thing that I want to say: real men never abuse women and children. Period. End of story,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hartzler said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time for Eric to get out of the Senate race and to get professional help.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Schmitt called the abuse allegations \u201a\u00c4\u00fasickening,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe behavior described in this affidavit is cause for Eric Greitens to be in prison, not on the ballot for U.S. Senate. He should end his campaign immediately.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Long said he was \u201a\u00c4\u00fashocked and appalled\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by what was in the affidavit, adding of Greitens: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe is clearly unfit to represent the state of Missouri in the United States Senate. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no way he can stay in this race.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, on Monday became the highest-ranking Republican to say Greitens should leave the race. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who called on Greitens to resign as governor in 2018 and has endorsed Hartzler in the Senate primary, also called for him to drop out, expressing concern that Republicans could lose the seat if Greitens were the nominee. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had no comment on Greitens on Monday. Walking in silence without saying anything, the Kentucky Republican would not respond to questions about whether the Senate candidate should drop out. On Tuesday, Blunt \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the senator Greitens is vying to replace \u201a\u00c4\u00ec also said Greitens should step aside if the allegations against him are true. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the statements filed with the court are true, he should not be a candidate for the Senate,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blunt told CNN. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 stunning fall from grace in 2018 came as he faced calls for impeachment from the GOP-controlled state legislature and a criminal charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec invasion of privacy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec related to a 2015 affair, in which his former hairdresser alleged he tied her up, coerced her into oral sex and threatened to blackmail her with partially nude photos to cover up their affair. Greitens admitted to the affair but refuted the blackmail claim. He was separately charged with another felony \u201a\u00c4\u00ec tampering with computer data \u201a\u00c4\u00ec for allegedly misusing a veterans charity\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s donor list for his 2016 gubernatorial campaign. The criminal charges against Greitens were dropped. And a former FBI agent investigating the blackmail allegations was later indicted for perjury and tampering with physical evidence. When a Missouri ethics panel investigated Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 campaign misconduct, it found no evidence of wrongdoing but fined the campaign for failing to report in-kind contributions. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 accuser never recanted her sexual misconduct allegations. Sheena Greitens said in her affidavit filed Monday that Eric Greitens admitted to her that he took the photo that resulted in the invasion of privacy charge, but \u201a\u00c4\u00fahe threatened that I would be exposed to legal jeopardy if I ever disclosed that fact to anyone.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She also alleged that in the spring and summer of 2018, \u201a\u00c4\u00faEric repeatedly threatened to kill himself unless I provided specific public support to him.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Earlier this year, the former governor told CNN that he did \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 nothing wrong with his former hairdresser and claimed that he resigned for his two children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt was the thing that I had to do for the people who I love the most, particularly for my boys, given those tremendous lies and the tremendous pressure that was on my kids,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. But Sheena Greitens pushed back on that explanation in her court filing, saying their young children were \u201a\u00c4\u00faunaware of the scandal, and I would like them to remain so until they are older.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have privately entreated Eric to stop introducing false and misleading information about our marriage and divorce into the public in his quest for political office,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to her court filing. Before the scandals, Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, was a rising star in the Republican Party. In the Senate race, he has completely aligned himself with former President Donald Trump. He has spread the lie that Trump won the 2020 presidential election, said he would not support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for Senate GOP leader and recently visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Florida resort, where he met with Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who advises his Senate campaign.

Earlier this week, a ProPublica report revealed Mr Thomas failed to disclose trips he took with real estate mogul Harlan Crow almost every year over the course of two decades, despite being required to file annual disclosures of gifts. In a statement on Friday, Mr Thomas said that he had been told by colleagues and others that \"this sort of personal hospitality\" did not need to be formally disclosed. Mr Thomas is one of nine justices on the Supreme Court serving lifetime appointments after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. Here is a look at the conservative justice and his eight colleagues who sit on the bench, including the Supreme Court's most recent member, Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal chosen by President Joe Biden last year. Jackson's appointment has not altered the 6-3 conservative majority on the court. On the court since: 23 October 1991 How he got to the court: Thomas was born in a small town in Georgia, and was one of the few African-Americans in attendance during a short stint in seminary and then at Holy Cross College. But unlike Justice Sotomayor, those experiences made him distrustful of affirmative action policies. After finishing Yale Law, he worked in Missouri government and in Washington DC before being named chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency that responds to discrimination claims in the workplace. After a bruising confirmation hearing - in which a former employee accused him of sexual harassment - Thomas was narrowly confirmed to Supreme Court, at the relatively young age of 43. Who is he as a justice? Thomas' originalism is exacting, including a disregard for stare decisis, respect for prior court rulings and precedence. Thomas has also not asked a question during oral arguments in nine years. He has previously said he doesn't care for the question-heavy arguments, sometimes already drafting opinions based on written briefs before any lawyer gets up to argue. Thomas often files entirely separate dissents rarely joined by others, but Coyle says he is influential in other ways, including during conferences only justices attend, and in \"difficult decisions\" in areas that don't get a lot of press - like intellectual property and tax law. Thomas replaced the first African-American justice on the court - Thurgood Marshall. On the court since: 3 October 2022 How she got to the court: The first black woman to sit on the court in its 233-year history is also the first justice since 1967 to come to the court with extensive experience as a criminal defence attorney. Before the US Supreme Court, the Washington DC native served on the influential US court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. Ms Jackson has said she has a \"methodology\" to deciding cases but not an overarching philosophy.\u00a0Some conservatives have accused her of being \"soft\" on criminals, pointing to her experience as a public defender and willingness as a federal judge to issue prison sentences below federal guidelines. Her confirmation came after President Biden pledged during his presidential campaign to appoint a black woman to the top court. On the court since: 31 January 2006 How he got to the court: Alito grew up in New Jersey in an Italian immigrant family. While at Princeton University, he was involved in conservative and libertarian groups, as well as the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps. After Yale law school, he was a prosecutor in New Jersey and served in the Reagan administration in the justice department, including as assistant to the solicitor general, where he argued before the Supreme Court. President George HW Bush named him to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1990, where he stayed until his nomination to The Supreme Court. Who is he as a justice? Alito is a conservative justice, but one who does not hew as often to originalism as fellow conservatives Scalia and Thomas. He is not always talkative in oral arguments  but his questions are sharp, aiming to pick apart an argument's logic. Alito has a low public profile despite being a large part of the court's rightward shift on business, campaign finance and racial issues over the past decade. The former prosecutor has been \"very pro-government\" in criminal cases, Coyle says, and has shown less willingness than his conservative colleagues to protect free speech in cases where it is harmful or hateful. On the court since: 7 August 2010 How she got to the court: Kagan grew up in New York City. At the age of 12, she convinced her rabbi to hold the synagogue's first formal bat mitzvah, the rite of passage for young women. After law school at Harvard, she clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. After a successful stint as the first female dean of Harvard Law School, she was briefly US solicitor general - the federal government's top representative at the US Supreme Court, before being nominated by President Barack Obama for the high court. Who is she as a justice? Kagan is the first justice in decades not to previously serve as a judge. She is part of the court's left-leaning wing, but has been the author of many of recent unanimous or near unanimous decisions. Her writing is often easy for a layperson to understand without sacrificing legal analysis, and she is an aggressive questioner during oral arguments. Kagan first took her seat at the bench at the age of 50 and could potentially be a force on the court for decades. Lithwick says Kagan is \"much more inscrutable\" on issues than other recent additions to the court. \"She's very close to the vest,\" she says. On the court since: 29 September 2005 How he got to the court: Born in New York and raised in Indiana, Roberts attended a boarding school as a teenager but also spent summers working in a steel mill. After considering becoming a historian at Harvard, he went to law school there instead, eventually clerking for then-Associate Justice Rehnquist. He spent many years as a lawyer in the Reagan administration then entered private practice, arguing before the high court and serving as one of several legal advisers to George W Bush in the Florida presidential recount case. Originally nominated to fill the spot left by retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Roberts was re-nominated for the chief justice position after Chief Justice Rehnquist died between terms, and his nomination was fast-tracked. Who is he as a justice: A conservative justice, Roberts is the third-youngest Chief Justice in the court's history, confirmed at 50 years old. Last year's term saw more than half its cases decided unanimously, something many court watchers cite as the outcome of Roberts' desire to foster agreement through narrower rulings. He also notably wrote the 5-4 opinion that shot down a major challenge to President Barack Obama's healthcare law. \"I think he cares deeply about how the 'Roberts court' looks,\" Lithwick says, and knows he can move the court slowly over decades. \"He doesn't want huge swings, except in areas he feels very strongly about,\" Coyle says, like government's role in racial issues, campaign finance's relation to free speech and the structure of constitution. Roberts also looks to keep decorum on the bench during oral arguments. On the court since: 8 August 2009 How she got to the court: Sotomayor was born to Puerto Rican parents in the Bronx. As a student at Princeton University, she fought for hiring more Latino professors and admitting more Latino students. After Yale Law school, she became a prosecutor in New York and was later named to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal appeals courts are often the final step before the Supreme Court for cases. In the second circuit, Sotomayor authored more than 150 majority opinions - including a few that were ultimately overruled by the higher court. Who is she as a justice? Sotomayor is the first Hispanic justice. She's also been one of the most public facing - her memoir appeared on the New York Times' best-selling list, she appeared twice on Sesame Street, once to adjudicate a dispute between Goldilocks and Baby Bear, and she helped drop the ball in Times Square on New Year's Eve 2013.  \"She's trying really hard to demystify the court, showing 'You can be a justice too',\" Lithwick says. Her former experience as a prosecutor and trial judge often leads her to challenge lawyers on the facts of a case, says Marcia Coyle, the chief Washington correspondent for the National Law Journal. \"She knows how criminal trials operate,\" Coyle says. On the court since: 10 April 2017 How he got to the court: At 49, Gorsuch was the youngest nominee in a quarter of a century when he was approved in 2017. The Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. He began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, and worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Who is he as a justice? Gorsuch succeeded the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and was welcomed by conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law. In his first year on the court he has cemented the 5-4 conservative advantage, and that's been seen in a series of rulings on contentious issues such as the Trump travel ban, trade union fees and gerrymandering. On the court since: 6 October 2018 How he got to the court: Kavanaugh served on the influential Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit and was formerly a White House aide under George W Bush. He previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. His confirmation process was one of the most controversial in recent years amid allegations of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, which he denied. After a hearing in which one of his accusers gave a dramatic testimony of the alleged incident and Kavanaugh fiercely defended his record, he was approved by the Senate by 50-48. Born in Washington, DC in 1965, Kavanaugh studied at Georgetown Preparatory School an all-boys school in Bethesda, Maryland, and graduated from Yale College and Yale Law School. Who is he as a justice? He succeeded Anthony Kennedy, who was the Supreme Court's swing vote, often casting the deciding opinion in 5-4 cases, consolidating a conservative majority at the top court. Some Democrats fiercely opposed to his name for his views on delicate issues such as abortion. His views on the environment and gun rights have also raised concerns among environmentalists and gun control activists. On the court since: 27 October 2020 How she got to the court: Born in New Orleans of Irish and French ancestry, Barrett was the eldest of seven children in a devoutly Catholic family and is now herself a mother of seven. She was the student body vice-president at her all-girls Catholic high school. After graduating first in her class at Notre Dame Law School, in Indiana, she clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, and later worked on George W Bush's election lawsuit in 2000. Barrett also became a distinguished law professor at her alma mater. She was picked for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 by President Donald Trump and was nominated to the high court less than three years later. Who is she as a justice? Often considered a protege of Justice Scalia, Barrett is a proponent of textualism, the view that judges should apply the law as written and interpret the US Constitution as it was originally intended. In her acceptance speech at the White House, Barrett said: \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\" She has said her Catholic faith does not influence her rulings. Past legal opinions and remarks on abortion and gay marriage have made her popular with the religious right, but have earned her vehement opposition from the left. She drew scrutiny for her reported leadership role, with the title of \"handmaid\", in the People of Praise, a tight-knit, Christian faith-based group.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Hood County, located on the Edwards Plateau, is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metro area. Erath County, to its west, is where two of North America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s largest renewable natural gas plants are located. Over the past week, firefighters have been trying to protect people and homes as 178 wildfires burned more than 108,000 acres across the state, the Texas A&M Forest Service said Monday. Ongoing and hard-to-control wildfires affecting southwest Texas were expected to get worse Monday, according to a forest service statement. Authorities said increased wildfire activity was due to \u201a\u00c4\u00facritical fire weather and high winds\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 detected Sunday along Interstate 35. Firefighters this past week have responded to 178 wildfires that burned 108,493 acres across the state, the statement said. As of Sunday, there were 23 active wildfires, Texas A&M Forest Service spokesperson Erin O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Connor said. The largest was the Eastland Complex Fire ripping through central Texas. The complex consists of seven fires totaling an estimated 54,463 acres and is now 60% contained, according to the interagency reporting website InciWeb. The seven fires in the Eastland Complex Fire are: The four initial fires that formed the Eastland Complex Fire began last Wednesday and Thursday, the forest service said. A total of 158 structures are reported destroyed, fire officials said. No differentiations have been reported between homes, businesses or outbuildings. The fires\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 causes are under investigation. On Friday, Gov. Greg Abbott said at least 50 homes across three communities had been destroyed. Some relief may come Monday afternoon as the region is expected to be in the path of severe storms and could get up to two inches of rain, CNN Meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. Statewide, the severe weather could impact up to 20 million Texans throughout the afternoon and evening hours, Shackelford added. Abbott directed the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s emergency management office to mobilize several units and put them on standby for rapid deployment, including two search and rescue teams and multiple swiftwater boat teams. At least one person has died as a result of the flames. Eastland County Deputy Sgt. Barbara Fenley died Thursday night as she helped evacuate people in the town of Carbon, about 100 miles west of Fort Worth. She was last heard from while on her way to assist an elderly person, the Eastland County Sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office said. Amid deteriorating conditions and low visibility from smoke, Fenley ran off the roadway and was killed in the flames, the sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office said. Abbott, who on Friday issued a disaster declaration for 11 counties, including Eastland, ordered flags be flown at half-staff in Fenley\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s honor. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will never forget her sacrifice,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the governor said.

The country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first woman justice, nominated by President Ronald Reagan, made deft use of the forum to introduce herself to the nation and eventually to win confirmation by a 99-0 vote. Since then, audiences have seen other historic moments, dramatic flashpoints and instances of levity. As the Senate begins its hearings for President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who would be the first Black woman justice, here are 10 of the many episodes that have stood out over the past four decades. She emphasized at the outset her experience as a state court judge in Arizona and her devotion to family. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBy way of preamble,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said as she began introducing her family, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI would note that \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I have performed some marriage ceremonies in my capacity as judge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She then read from the form she used describing marriage as \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe foundation of the family, mankind\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s basic unit of society, the hope of the world and strength of the country.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Connor was a former state senator and experienced politician who nimbly handled queries about the law and her life. The Senate confirmed her without any dissent. This nominee of Reagan with a deeply conservative record faced a Democratic Senate, and in particular, Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy set much of the tone when he dramatically claimed of the then-President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s plan to elevate the US appellate court judge: \u201a\u00c4\u00faRobert Bork\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, Blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 doors in midnight raids.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 At the hearings, Bork\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s right-wing ideology, rather than his intelligence and experience, remained the focus. When asked why he wanted to be a justice, he memorably stressed the \u201a\u00c4\u00faintellectual feast\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of it all: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have spent my life in the intellectual pursuits in the law. And since I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been a judge, I particularly like the courtroom. I like the courtroom as an advocate and I like the courtroom as a judge. \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 (T)hat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s of course the Court that has the most interesting cases and issues, and I think it would be an intellectual feast just to be there and to read the briefs and discuss things with counsel and discuss things with my colleagues.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bork was defeated 58-42. He was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to succeed the first Black justice, Thurgood Marshall, who was retiring. Thomas, also African American, underwent two sets of hearings, the first devoted to his substantive record, the second following the sexual harassment accusations of law professor Anita Hill, a former Thomas employee. He categorically denied the charges, declaring to the committee, chaired by then-Sen. Joe Biden, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is a circus. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a national disgrace. And from my standpoint as a Black American, as far as I am concerned, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate confirmed him 52-48, which at that point was the closest Supreme Court confirmation vote in more than a century. President George W. Bush nominated him to be chief justice upon the death of William Rehnquist, and Roberts\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 balls-and-strikes metaphor continues to be evoked by judicial candidates today: \u201a\u00c4\u00faJudges are like umpires,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Roberts told senators. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUmpires don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t make the rules, they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Roberts was confirmed for chief justice by a 78-22 vote. Biden remained an active Senate Judiciary Committee questioner even after he passed on the committee chairmanship, and he brought in a prop for an exchange with Alito. The then-senator was exploring the nominee\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s connection to a Princeton alumni group reputed to oppose the admission of women and minorities. Biden first referred to Alito\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Italian-American background and his own Irish Catholic roots. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI read your opening statement again, where you said that, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2A generation earlier I think that somebody from my background probably would not have felt fully comfortable at a college like Princeton.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s how I felt,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Biden, who went to the University of Delaware for college. Biden then produced a Princeton cap and put it on. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI can wear this hat proudly today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, because the university improved its record of women and minority admissions. Alito told senators he could not recall participating in the controversial group. The Senate confirmed him 58-42. The child of Puerto Rican parents was nominated by President Barack Obama as the first Hispanic justice. She drew some controversy for a remark she often made as she spoke to women\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legal groups, that \u201a\u00c4\u00faI would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t lived that life.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Some Republicans contended the comment was racist and it began to take on a life of its own. At her hearings, Sotomayor said she wanted to make clear that she was simply trying to inspire Latinas to believe that their life experiences would enrich the legal system. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI want to state upfront and unequivocally and without doubt, I do not believe any ethnic, racial, or gender group has an advantage in sound judging.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She was confirmed 68-31. Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second nominee produced one of the lighter memorable exchanges as she was questioned by Sen. Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina Republican began asking her about a failed al Qaeda bomb plot on Christmas Day in 2009. Kagan was wary about where he was heading with his questioning about the man apprehended. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Graham said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just asked you where you were on Christmas.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She rejoined, \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou know, like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Appreciating the levity, Graham said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faGreat answer.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate approved Kagan 63-37. President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first choice for the high court had a record from more than a decade as a US appellate court judge based in Denver, but one case was particularly targeted. It involved a trucker whose rig had broken down in sub-zero temperatures and who, against company rules, unhitched it and drove away to warm up awhile. When the case came before him, Gorsuch interpreted federal law to say the trucker who was fired was not covered by the usual statutory labor protections. Then-Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, drilled down on the case, identifying with the trucker and describing his plight as \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsurd.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Gorsuch said his decision was limited by his interpretation of the law at issue. When pressed by Franken about what he would have done if he had been a trucker, the judge said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faOh, Senator, I do not know what I would have done if I were in his shoes, and I do not blame him at all for a moment for doing what he did. I empathize with him entirely.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate confirmed Gorsuch 54-45. This Trump nominee, like Thomas, had two sets of hearings, the second prompted by a sexual assault claim raised by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, dating to their teenage years living in the Washington, DC, suburbs. Kavanaugh categorically denied the claim and told the committee, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades. This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country. And as we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around. I am an optimistic guy, I always try to be on the sunrise side of the mountain, to be optimistic about the day that is coming, but today I have to say that I fear for the future.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate confirmed him 50-48. Graham chaired the Judiciary Committee hearings for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s third nominee and declared at the outset, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is the first time in American history that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve nominated a woman who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Barrett, a former Notre Dame law professor, had been vocal regarding her Catholic faith and opposition to abortion rights. In her own testimony, Barrett said she had \u201a\u00c4\u00fano agenda\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 regarding the reversal of the Supreme Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s abortion rights precedent dating to the 1973 Roe v. Wade. Barrett testified without notes and, at the urging of Sen. John Cornyn, held up the blank notepad that was on the desk before her. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s impressive,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Texas Republican said. The Senate confirmed her 52-48.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

One worshipper knocked the axe from the man's hands, and held him down until police arrived, local media reports. A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene in the suburb of Mississauga, and he has since been charged. Some congregants had minor injures from the bear spray, the mosque's imam said. One of the worshippers said the experience was \"terrifying\" and described hearing a scream before turning around to see a man holding an axe and using bear spray - similar to pepper spray - against three people. \"By the time he was spraying, the people in the first row realized something was going on and one of the young men turned around and knocked away the axe before he had a chance to use it,\" Noorani Sairally told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. The young man then held the alleged assailant down until police arrived, the witness said. \"Before he could inflict harm on any worshippers, several congregants bravely were able to stop him in his tracks,\" imam Ibrahim Hindy said in a statement, describing the moment the attacker entered the site. \"Our community will never be broken and we refuse to be intimidated,\" he added. Police have named the man they arrested as Mohammad Moiz Omar, and charged him with six offences including assault with a weapon and administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm. Following initial uncertainty over a possible motive, investigators now say they believe the attack was a \"hate-motivated incident.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of a number of high-profile Canadian public figures to condemn the attack, which he described as \"incredibly disturbing\" and applauded the courage of the worshippers at the mosque.

Omer Kuzu, 26, testified on Monday that he met El Shafee Elsheikh in Syria on at least five occasions. He said while they did not talk much, Mr Elsheikh had an air of importance. Mr Elsheikh, 33, is accused of kidnapping and conspiracy and has denied all the charges. The Sudanese-born Londoner is alleged to have been part of an IS militant cell dubbed the Beatles by hostages because of their British accents. He is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US. The cell is said to have tortured and beheaded hostages in Syria, including several Western journalists and aid workers. Mr Kuzu, who spent four-and-a-half years as an IS member, testified at Mr Elsheikh's trial in Virginia as part of a plea deal with the US government. He said he had left his home in Dallas, Texas, at age 18 in October 2014 and was smuggled into Syria alone through the Turkish border. He told the court he worked at the telecommunications office in the city of Raqqa, then \"the capital of IS\", and did \"typical IT work\" to support the group's battlefield operations. Mr Kuzu was captured by Syrian forces in 2019 and handed over to the FBI. He pleaded guilty in Texas in September 2020 on a charge of conspiring to provide material support to IS. Taking the stand on Monday in a teal prison jumpsuit, he leaned forward into his microphone and spoke clearly, often saying \"yes sir\" in response to questions. Mr Kuzu said that while other guards wore traditional Afghan clothes, Mr Elsheikh wore a green military uniform and always carried a Glock pistol. Having a Glock was uncommon among the fighters, he said, calling it \"a symbol of Isis aristocracy\". He added that Mr Elsheikh was \"quiet, reserved, almost secretive\", which he believed indicated he didn't want to be a target of foreign intelligence agencies. Asked to identify Mr Elsheikh in the courtroom, he pointed at the defendant and described his clothing. Mr Elsheikh, who has sat through much of the trial in a disposable black mask, lowered his mask to be identified. Identification is a key part of the trial. The defence argues that Mr Elsheikh was a \"simple Isis fighter\" not one of the so-called Beatles, and therefore should not be held responsible for what that militant cell did. Under cross-examination, Mr Kuzu admitted that Mr Elsheikh had never explicitly told him about himself or what he did for IS. But he said \"his work was right in front of my eyes\". The Beatles have been described by witnesses as a cohesive unit. When Mr Kuzu met Mr Elsheikh and another alleged Beatle on one occasion, they appeared to be \"some sort of a duo or tag team\" to him. Former French IS hostage Didier Francois echoed similar sentiments when he took the stand on Monday. He told the court \"the atmosphere changed radically\" whenever the Beatles showed up. \"They were always together and always sadistic,\" the veteran war correspondent said, explaining they engaged in both physical and emotional abuse. \"Manicure or pedicure?\" they would ask, he claimed, before beating his hands and feet. Mr Francois was held alongside three other French journalists for 10 months before the men were all released together in April 2014. He described interacting with several other hostages during his captivity, including Americans James Foley and Peter Kassig. Both men converted to Islam while in captivity. Choking up, Mr Francois recalled the former asking him to tell his Catholic mother he had only done so because \"he loved his God and wanted to be able to worship him\". The government is expected to wrap its case against Mr Elsheikh on Tuesday. It remains unclear whether Mr Elsheikh intends to take the stand when the defence gets its turn.

Chuck Grassley. Finkenauer pledged Monday to \u201a\u00c4\u00fachallenge this deeply partisan decision to the Iowa Supreme Court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Sunday night, Polk County District Judge Scott Beattie ruled that Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name \u201a\u00c4\u00fashall not be included on the primary ballot for the Democratic Primary for U.S. Senate.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The ruling centers around a dispute over the signatures required to get on the ballot. Although Finkenaur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign submitted more than the necessary 3,500 signatures, the judge found that she did not meet the requirement that each candidate have at least 100 signatures from at least 19 Iowa counties due to questions about three signatures obtained from Allamakee and Cedar counties. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Court takes no joy in this conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beattie wrote. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis Court should not be in the position to make a difference in an election, and Ms. Finkenauer and her supporters should have a chance to advance her candidacy. However, this Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s job is to sit as a referee and apply the law without passion or prejudice. It is required to rule without consideration of the politics of the day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finkenauer initially responded to the decision by saying her campaign was \u201a\u00c4\u00faexploring all of our options to fight back hard.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Later on Monday, Finkenauer announced she would challenge the decision with the Iowa Supreme Court. Finkenauer lawyer asks Iowa Supreme Court to return her to primary ballot in fight over signatures \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe refuse to back down in the face of these partisan attacks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are confident that we have met every requirement to be on the ballot, and we will not stop fighting back against this meritless attack that seeks to silence the voices of tens of thousands of Iowans.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Although Finkenauer has blamed Republicans for her signature issues, Democratic operatives in Iowa have been quietly aghast at how a statewide candidate, let alone someone who successfully ran for Congress recently, cut it so close on the signatures needed to make the ballot. The success of Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge will now rest with seven justices on Iowa\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00ec only one of whom was appointed by a Democrat. If Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge is unsuccessful, the former congresswoman could accept the ruling and run as a write-in candidate in the June primary. This could be complicated by the fact that although Finkenauer, a former congresswoman, was the front-runner in the Democratic field, she is running against two other Democrats: Glenn Hurst, a city council member in Minden, Iowa, and Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral. Republicans have been challenging Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signatures, initially bringing the complaint to the State Objections Panel. The state body decided in March that Finkenauer could stay on the ballot, but just narrowly. The panel found that Finkenauer submitted at least 100 signatures from 20 counties and needed 19. One of those counties was knocked out by the objection but she was able to squeak by with 100 signatures in one challenged county and 101 in two others. But Republicans successfully brought this lawsuit, saying the panel incorrectly interpreted the law. Iowa Republicans celebrated the decision on Monday, with Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann arguing that the questions surrounding Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signatures shows a \u201a\u00c4\u00fasevere lack of enthusiasm behind Iowa Democrats.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot qualifying for the ballot is a complete and utter embarrassment,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kaufmann said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Navy that once wanted smaller, speedy warships to chase down pirates has made a speedy pivot to Russia and China \u2013 and many of those recently built ships could be retired. The U.S. Navy wants to decommission nine ships in the Freedom-class of littoral combat ships \u2013 warships that cost about $4.5 billion to build. THE PENTAGON IS INVESTIGATING EXTREMISM IN THE MILITARY. HERE\u2019S HOW BAD THE PROBLEM IS The Navy contends in its budget proposal that the move would free up $50 million per ship annually for other priorities. But it would also reduce the size of the fleet that\u2019s already surpassed by China in sheer numbers, something that could cause members of Congress to balk. Adm. Mike Gilday, chief of naval operations, defended the proposal that emphasizes long-range weapons and modern warships, while shedding other ships ill-equipped to face current threats.

BIDENS HONOR THE NAVY'S NEW SUBMARINE AT CEREMONY FOR USS DELAWARE All told, the Navy wants to scrap 24 ships, including five cruisers and a pair of Los Angeles-class submarines, as part of its cost-cutting needed to maintain the existing fleet and build modern warships. Those cuts surpass the proposed nine ships to be built. Most of them are older vessels. However, the littoral combat ships that are targeted are young. The oldest of them is 10 years old. NAVY IDS OFFICER KILLED IN E-2D HAWKEYE CRASH OFF VIRGINIA The littoral combat ship program was announced after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The ships topped 50 mph (80 kph) \u2013 fast enough to chase down pirates \u2013 and were highly maneuverable, even in shallow water, thanks to steerable waterjets instead of propellers. The ships were supposed to be made versatile through plug-and-play mission modules for surface combat, mine-sweeping operations or anti-submarine warfare. But those mission modules were beset by problems, and the anti-submarine capability was canceled in the new budget. Crew members of the USS Sioux City, a Freedom-class of littoral combat ship, gather before the ship's commissioning ceremony on Nov. 17, 2018, at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) And what about that speed? The fastest ship can\u2019t outrun missiles, and firing up those marine turbines for an extra burst of speed turned the ships into gas guzzlers, analysts said. Early versions also were criticized as too lightly armed and armored to survive combat. The speedy Freedom-class ships proposed for decommissioning feature a traditional steel hull. That entire class of ships suffers from a propulsion defect that will be costly to repair. The Navy proposes keeping a second variant, the aluminum Independence class. SUPREME COURT WON'T PROTECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, BUT NAVY SEALS NEVER QUIT U.S. Senate Armed Services Chair Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said the program was plagued by troubles from the start, and that \"moving forward the Navy must avoid similar acquisition disasters.\" U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Virginia, was more blunt, tweeting that it \"sucks\" to be decommissioning so many ships, especially newer ones. \"The Navy owes a public apology to American taxpayers for wasting tens of billions of dollars on ships they now say serve no purpose,\" she said. A sailor salutes from the USS Sioux City during the ship's commissioning ceremony, Nov. 17, 2018, in Annapolis, Maryland. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) Some detractors proclaimed littoral combat ships to be the Navy\u2019s \"Little Crappy Ship,\" but that\u2019s not fair, said defense analyst Loren Thompson. \"It\u2019s not a little crappy ship. It does what it was supposed to do. What it was supposed to do isn\u2019t enough for the kind of threats that we face today,\" said Thompson, from the Lexington Institute. In the Navy\u2019s defense, threats shifted swiftly from the Cold War to the war on terror to the current Great Power Competition in which Russia and China are asserting themselves, he said. NAVY AIRCRAFT CRASHES IN VIRGINIA WATERS; TWO RESCUED, ONE CONFIRMED DEAD: REPORT In the end, the Navy may be content with smaller numbers of Freedom-class ships for maritime security and small surface combatant operations, said Bryan Clark, defense analyst at the Hudson Institute. Congress must sign off on the Navy\u2019s proposal to decommission ships ahead of their projected service life.

Branch/U.S. Navy via AP, File) U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., suggested the ship cuts were \"grossly irresponsible\" when the U.S. Navy has dipped from 318 ships to 297, while the Chinese fleet has grown from 210 to 360 ships over the past two decades. Milley said it\u2019s important to focus on the Navy\u2019s capabilities rather than the size of its fleet.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAfter 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians \u201a\u00c4\u00fahostage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration. Ukrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing \u201a\u00c4\u00fachildren, women and the elderly\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 out of the city, and have launched an attack \u201a\u00c4\u00faprecisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Joint Forces Operation said. CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response. A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been \u201a\u00c4\u00faisolated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it \u201a\u00c4\u00fain any significant way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days. Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe main issue today remains humanitarian aid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video. Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are \u201a\u00c4\u00faforced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, adding that Moscow is preventing \u201a\u00c4\u00fahumanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces \u201a\u00c4\u00faviolated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance in northern Ukraine. That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing \u201a\u00c4\u00faseveral civilians\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fasidelines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe will fight to the end,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s famous wartime speech. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrengthen the sanctions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a terrorist state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. Zelensky's heroism is coming up against Western red lines \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stoltenberg. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe situation could spiral out of control,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe other half largely from inside Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA little bit more than 70\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles have been fired from Belarus, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faonly a half dozen or so\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal was \u201a\u00c4\u00fatenable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal is a tenable one.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was \u201a\u00c4\u00faultimately one for the Polish government,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces. The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe prospect of fighter jets \u201a\u00c4\u00f2at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either. US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so. Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday. Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s. Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine. A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere (she) ought to have heard about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nuland told lawmakers. The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faready to deploy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec immediately and free of charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said. Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country. By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in \u201a\u00c4\u00fainteragency\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 discussions to \u201a\u00c4\u00faexamine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine. Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland. Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized. The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn fact, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re handing over to the Ukrainians? We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in very active discussions with them about that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said Sunday. A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely. Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.

In a statement, the Academy said the 94th Oscars had been \"overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behaviour we saw Mr Smith exhibit on stage\". Smith has apologised for his actions and resigned from the Academy. The actor hit Rock for joking about his wife's shaved head, a result of the hair-loss condition alopecia. Less than an hour later, he was awarded the best actor award for his role in King Richard, where he played the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards ceremony, met virtually on Friday to discuss disciplinary action. In a statement, it said banning Smith was aimed at protecting performers and guests and \"restoring trust in the Academy\". The Academy said that directly after the slap it did not \"adequately address the situation in the room\" and had been \"unprepared for the unprecedented\". It apologised for this. It also thanked Rock for \"maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances\". In his resignation statement, Smith said he had \"betrayed the trust of the Academy\" and was \"heartbroken\" over his actions. He added he would \"fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct\". Smith's resignation means he will be unable to vote for future Oscars. The Academy's disciplinary review over the incident, originally scheduled for 18 April, was fast-tracked after he resigned. Few have ever stepped down from the Academy. Four members - producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Bill Cosby, director Roman Polanski and cinematographer Adam Kimmel - have been booted over sexual misconduct allegations, while actor Carmine Caridi was expelled in 2004 for pirating screener videos given to him. But the standards of conduct laid out by the film academy contained various disciplinary options for Smith, such as excluding him from future Oscars ceremonies, revoking his eligibility for awards or taking back his newly won Oscar. Only one Oscar has ever been taken back; a feature called Young Americans won the best documentary honour in 1969 but was found to be ineligible for the award that year. Late last month, actor Whoopi Goldberg - a member of the Academy's board of governors - predicted Smith would face \"big consequences\" but said \"we're not going to take that Oscar away from him.\" Beyond the Academy's actions, at least two studios - Sony and Netflix - are pausing their projects with Smith. Rock, who began his latest stand up comedy tour shortly after the Oscars telecast, has not commented publicly on the slap. He told fans at a show last month that he is \"still kind of processing what happened\" and will talk about the incident \"at some point\".

More than 900 civilians killed in a matter of weeks. Is Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal? His country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine has presented reams of evidence that have led some world leaders \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including US President Joe Biden last week \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to use the loaded label. The question now is what Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which he followed up by calling Putin a \u201a\u00c4\u00famurderous dictator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapure thug\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will mean for the war in Ukraine going forward. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t signal any concern that Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks would roil talks with Russia. He told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Fareed Zakaria that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faready for negotiations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with Putin. (More on this in a minute.) Biden's strategy with Putin is decades in the making Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments represented a major moment since leading officials had mostly avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. But soon after the President uttered the words \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think he is a war criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to reporters at an unrelated event, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the comment was \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom the heart.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Other officials used similar language. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hard not to walk away with that conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 State Department spokesman Ned Price later told CNN. And after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he \u201a\u00c4\u00fapersonally\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 agreed with Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s label of Putin, Psaki told reporters that the top US diplomat was speaking from the heart \u201a\u00c4\u00faas well.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Why all the parsing? While terms like \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar crimes\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are often used colloquially, they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Conventions, which specify intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime. In other words, the White House is being careful to not get ahead of the international investigations probing Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Will Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s words complicate Ukraine-Russia negotiations? The Kremlin called Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks about Putin being a war criminal \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Asked if it would be hard to sit down with Putin, Zelensky maintained Sunday that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ready \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and has been ready. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout delay,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 warning that otherwise Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s losses would be \u201a\u00c4\u00fahuge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The problem, as CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security team reports, is that US and NATO officials believe Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s engagement truly is \u201a\u00c4\u00ec even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Everything you need to know about war crimes and how Putin could be prosecuted The view from the State Department. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday also expressed her personal view that war crimes are being committed in Russia, saying that they \u201a\u00c4\u00faall feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but noted that there must be \u201a\u00c4\u00faa body of proof\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 before a legal determination can be made. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there is virtually no one \u201a\u00c4\u00ec maybe Vladimir Putin is the exception \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who can look at all of the photographs, all of video coming from Ukraine and not believe that Putin is intentionally targeting civilians, and intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in an interview with CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s John Berman on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow, I think we all feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sherman said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in terms of international law, you have to have evidence, you have to have a body of proof that in fact there was intentionality.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added that the United States is \u201a\u00c4\u00fahelping to pull that evidence together, present it to international justice parties and then have a legal threshold that is met.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 How long do war crime investigations take? Investigations at the International Criminal Court take many years, and only a handful of convictions have ever been won. Put differently, it could be a while before Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 remarks have any legal weight \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if ever. As we noted earlier this month, the court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia. That seems unlikely.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

In a Thursday news conference, federal investigators said the truck's left tyre - which was a spare - blew out before swerving into the oncoming van. Six university golfers, including one from Portugal and one from Mexico, and their coach died in the crash. Both the young pickup driver and his passenger were also killed. Two students, both from Canada, survived the collision and are in a stable condition but still in hospital. Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt Victor Taylor\u00a0told the Associated Press news agency that it would be illegal for a 13-year-old to be driving in the state. Children are allowed to begin classroom driving lessons at the age of 14 in Texas, and must be 15 before they can start driving with an instructor or licensed adult in the car. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said in Thursday's news conference that it's still unclear how fast the vehicles were moving when they collided head-on on a two-lane highway near the New Mexico border, causing both vehicles to burst into flames. Several of the victims in the van were not wearing seatbelts, the NTSB said, adding that one passenger was ejected from the vehicle. The information is preliminary, officials added, and the investigation into the \"mass casualty event\" is expected to last several more months. The victims from the University of the Southwest - a private university in New Mexico - include golf coach Tyler James, 26; Jackson Zinn, 22; Karisa Raines, 21; Travis Garcia; 19; Laci Stone, 18, as well as Portuguese national Tiago Sousa, 18; and Mexican citizen Mauricio Sanchez, 19. Henrich Siemens, 38. was named as the pickup truck passenger. The name of the boy driving the vehicle is not being released due to his age. The accident occurred in Andrews County in west Texas on Tuesday night, just after 20:00 local time (01:00 GMT). A Ford Transit passenger van was carrying members of the both men's and women's golf teams from a golf tournament, authorities said. The other vehicle involved was a Dodge 2500 pickup truck. The Ford had been travelling northbound on the FM1788 roadway in Texas, while the Dodge pickup was travelling southbound. The two surviving golfers are undergoing medical treatment in Lubbock, Texas. Their families have arrived from Canada to be with them, a university official said on Thursday, adding that one is doing well enough to be able to sit up and eat soup.

Specifically Ari Wegner, a name you're going to be hearing a lot more often from now on. It may be 2022, but the combination of both a female director and a female director of photography is still a rare occurrence in Hollywood. The pair combined to create an unsettling and menacing western which tackles toxic masculinity and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as complicated, malevolent cowboy Phil, who forms an unlikely friendship with a younger man, Pete (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The film is leading the pack at this year's Academy Awards with 12 nominations, including best picture, best director and best cinematography - Wegner could be the first woman to win the latter. For many, that female recognition is cause for celebration after the so-called \"male gaze\" has dominated Hollywood for so long. But is there such thing as \"the female gaze\" and if so, what does that bring to a traditionally male genre like a western? Campion, who is now the first woman to be nominated for two best director Oscars, isn't sure. \"It's so hard to know how much to believe in the female gaze or the male gaze,\" she tells the BBC. \"I think, to me, it's really the artist's gaze, bringing your sensitivity to the story. [But] I really wanted to have a woman cinematographer on this film, because there's so many other men and I really like to support women.\" Wegner, who previously worked with Campion on a commercial, told the BBC's culture editor Katie Razzall: \"There probably is a gender element to it, but it's also just what interests you, what your upbringing is, what you notice. \"And I think maybe Jane and I are similar in that way, really fascinated by subtle kinds of energy between people and what's not being said.\" Campion says it's thanks to the film's \"feminist\" producer Roger Frappier that she got on board with the project in the first place after a meeting in Cannes. \"It's very lucky that he really trusted me with this story, which you would think is a book for the kind of big-guy type of person that would handle ranch material - even though I do ride horses, and my parents did have cattle on the farm (Campion grew up in New Zealand). \"I was grateful to him for believing in me. And I was grateful to Savage's book, which is kind of subversive... when you think about most western genre movies, they're really a kind of celebration of masculinity in one way or another... and often a romanticised version of what a man is. \"In Savage's hands, he ripped through it really, and showed us a very true and different version.\" His version is one Campion and Cumberbatch have faithfully brought to life on screen through the latter's swaggering, snarling and insidious presence. The film also stars real-life couple Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst as Phil's brother and his wife Rose, who is also Pete's mother. The film is Campion's first in more than a decade and has been largely well received by critics, with The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw describing it as \"one of Campion's best\" and Empire's Beth Webb noting that while the \"narrative here feels somewhat underdeveloped... Campion remains a master of sensory storytelling\". The Netflix film is another feather in the streaming giant's cap, but Cumberbatch recently told Vanity Fair he wished the film had enjoyed a longer cinema release (it had a finite two-week run before it headed exclusively to Netflix). Campion concurs. \"I'd have loved it to have been out in the cinema for longer but that wasn't the plan that Netflix had. However, I would have to say that we wouldn't have made the film at all without Netflix. They were the only people that were willing to pay what this film cost to make and they are incredibly supportive.\" She adds that Netflix are now putting the film out in cinemas again \"because of the 12 nominations that we got and you know, the general interest in it and people wanting to see it on a big screen\". Campion also points out that streaming brings the film - which is essentially an arthouse one - to a bigger and wider audience, making it more accessible.  And she's delighted with the attention it's getting, including the awards buzz. \"I'm kind of thrilled. I feel like I've had kind of a comeback. I do feel really quite moved. People in the Academy have voted for so many categories.\" She also understands it has greater significance for women in the industry as a whole after the shocking revelations about the abuse of women in Hollywood including the Harvey Weinstein scandal. \"I really feel that the MeToo movement changed everything. I think it was a very dark time in the late 90s. And up to about 2015. It was almost as if nobody was hearing the fact there was such a depth of inequality. \"And when those brave ladies shared their stories... everybody woke up and went: 'It's really been impossible, and it's incredibly unequal, and we're not going to have it.' \"It's just not OK to have so little representation of women in film and TV. I think women are doing so well. It's no longer charitable to be employing women. And that's the big change. We want to be recognised because we are really good!\" Wegner is also blazing a trail on the awards circuit. As well as the Oscar nomination, she is the first woman ever to receive a Bafta nod for best cinematography. \"I think the visibility really matters because everyone's the harshest critic of their own work, but it is something very meaningful to be recognised by your peers,\" she told Razzall. The Australian says she was \"so na\u00efve\" when she first decided to go into her field. \"I had no idea that it was not a job that women usually did. It wasn't really until later in film school that I heard this term female cinematographer. And it slowly dawned on me that there were very few but... it was too late. I'd already decided [my career].\" The most recent annual Celluloid Ceiling report found that women comprised 21% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers working on the top 100 grossing films in 2020, up from 20% in 2019. Women also make up 50% of movie-goers. Campion says: \"We just have to keep going this way. It can never go back to what it was. It was a really dark time when people didn't want to see what women thought or made films about but now there's a real appetite amongst audiences, men and women. \"Netflix are actively seeking to keep their ratio of material made by women up. It's acts like that that make a real difference. \"And hiring Ari for an ambitious film like this one. Is that a risk? Well, I don't think it was a risk. She's really talented. All she needed was people that believe in her and to give her that opportunity, supporting her to make sure she does succeed. And she did succeed.

Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the measure, which would bar teachers from teaching these topics to children under 10 years old. Critics say the bill will isolate LGBT youth. Proponents say it is about empowering parents on education issues. Activists have dubbed it the Don't Say Gay bill. It is officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Bill. The Republican-backed legislation passed on Tuesday. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics \"when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\". White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday decried the passing of \"hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students\". President Joe Biden and his administration are \"with LGBTQI+ students everywhere\", she wrote on Twitter. State laws that ban or constrain the discussion of LGBT life in classrooms - sometimes called \"no promo homo\" laws by critics - are not uncommon. Four US states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas - currently have laws on the books that explicitly prohibit or limit sex education to heterosexual activity. The Florida bill also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Representative Joe Harding, who sponsored the bill in Florida's statehouse, has said that the bill is simply about \"empowering parents\". Critics say that vague language in the law could result in teachers and students being prevented from discussing their lives even outside the classroom. \"This is really about making it impossible for LGBT young people to speak for themselves,\" said Nadine Smith, the executive director of advocacy group Equality Florida. Todd and Jeff Delmay - one of the first same-sex couples to get married in Florida - say this bill would make it impossible for their 11-year-old son Blake to talk freely about his dads. \"We have fought and won these battles to adopt children and to be a family and to be together,\" Todd told the BBC. \"And they are now trying to find every way in which they can erase us and our families.\" And the couple warned the bill could marginalise LGBT youth as they  come to terms with their identity. \"A child's need for acceptance in a safe space should always take precedence over some parents' belief,\" Todd said, adding that legal challenges were already under way. The Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative group that supports the bill, said in a statement last week that it was \"necessary because government schools in the US have become ideological, political and are more interested in shaping a child's politics and sexual inclinations than they are in teaching academics of reading, writing, math, and education\". Governor DeSantis - widely regarded as a possible 2024 White House contender - endorsed the bill last month, saying it was part of a wider effort to make the education system \"transparent\" to parents. The Florida bill is part of a fierce debate taking place across the US over children's education, how schools operate and what they teach. Why are certain books being banned in US?

The vehicle, known as the Space Launch System (SLS), was taken to Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to conduct a dummy countdown. If that goes well, the rocket will be declared ready for a mission in which it will send an uncrewed test capsule around the Moon. This could happen in the next couple of months. Ultimately, it's hoped astronauts would climb aboard later SLS rockets to return to the Moon's surface sometime in the second half of this decade. These missions are part of what Nasa calls its Artemis programme. Watching the roll-out, agency administrator Bill Nelson said we were entering a golden era of human space exploration. \"The Artemis generation is preparing to reach new frontiers,\" he told the spectator crowds gathered at Kennedy. \"This generation will return astronauts to the Moon and this time, we will land the first woman and the first person of colour on the surface, to conduct ground-breaking science. \"Nasa's Artemis programme will pave the way for humanity's giant leap (to) future missions to Mars.\" SLS is a colossus. A touch under 100m in height, it was designed to be more powerful than the Apollo Saturn vehicles of the late 1960s and early 1970s. It will have the thrust to not only send astronauts far beyond Earth but additionally so much equipment and cargo that those crews could stay away for extended periods. Thursday's rollout from Kennedy's Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the rocket's debut in the sense that it's the very first time everyone has got to see all its different elements fully stacked together. The SLS move from the VAB began 17:47 local Florida time. The rocket came out attached to a support gantry known as the Mobile Launcher. This structure, which is itself 120m high and weighs 5,000 tonnes, was sitting atop the same mammoth tractor that used to move the Saturn Vs back in the day, and later the space shuttles. The Crawler Transporter goes very slowly, with a cruising speed of just over 1km/h (under 1mph). And after engineers had stopped and started the tractor for various checks, it was 04:15 on Friday morning by the time the procession had reached Pad 39B. A total journey distance of 6.75km. SLS will now be prepared for a \"wet dress rehearsal\", likely to occur on 3 April. This will see the rocket loaded with propellants and taken through a practice countdown all the way to a mere 9.4 seconds from the moment of lift-off. The \"scrub\" point is just before they would normally light the four big shuttle-era engines under the rocket. Assuming everything proceeds to the satisfaction of the engineers, Nasa will then be able to set a flight date. The end of May remains a possibility, but more likely it will be June or July. This mission, dubbed Artemis-1, will propel the rocket's Orion crew capsule on a 26-day journey that includes an expanded orbit around the Moon. There will be no-one in the capsule for the test flight. This should happen on a second mission in a couple of years' time. While Nasa is developing the SLS, the American rocket entrepreneur Elon Musk is preparing an even larger vehicle at his R&D facility in Texas. He calls his giant rocket the Starship. Like SLS it has yet to have a maiden flight. Unlike SLS, Starship has been designed to be totally reusable and ought therefore to be considerably cheaper to operate. A recent assessment from the Office of Inspector General, which audits Nasa programmes, found that the first four SLS missions would each cost more than $4bn to execute - a sum of money that was described as \"unsustainable\".\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Kayla Mueller, 26, was one of several people who died at the hands of a Syria-based IS terror cell dubbed the Beatles due to their British accents. On Tuesday, her mother Marsha spoke at the federal trial of El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, known as \"Jihadi George\". He has denied charges of hostage-taking and conspiracy to murder. Mr Elsheikh is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US and the only alleged member of the notorious Beatles cell to do so. He has been linked to at least 27 abductions, but has asserted that he was not part of the group. The Sudanese-born Londoner, who was stripped of his British citizenship in 2018, is accused of taking hostages, resulting in the deaths of four Americans - Ms Mueller, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. He is also charged with conspiring in the deaths of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. In opening statements last week, his lawyer argued that he was \"a simple ISIS fighter\" who went to Syria alone to support \"suffering Muslims\". But prosecutors played back past media interviews with Mr Elsheikh that contradict the claim he was not involved in the hostage taking scheme. During one interview, Mr Elsheikh describes asking the jailed Ms Mueller for an email address to reach her family, although he goes on to say he never sent any emails. Inside the Virginia courthouse on Tuesday, Ms Mueller's mother described exchanging several emails with the IS captors, in which she begged for her daughter's life. In their first contact with the so-called Beatles, she and her husband Carl were asked to submit proof of life questions for Ms Mueller to answer. Later emails include a video addressed to then-IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in which Marsha wore a hijab \"to show respect\". The Beatles wrote back demanding either a ransom of five million euros or the release of jihadist Aafia Siddiqui from a US federal prison, within 30 days. Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman sometimes known as \"Lady Al-Qaeda\", is serving 86 years for the attempted murder of US soldiers. When the Muellers replied they were retired and the payoff was \"more than [what] we could earn in several lifetimes\", the captors wrote: \"get back to work\", the court heard. The Obama administration had reassured the Muellers that \"IS won't harm a woman\", Marsha testified. But US officials confirmed in February 2015 that Ms Mueller had been killed in custody. Her body was never recovered. Marsha sat just yards away from the accused, who sat still leaning back in his chair and took no notes during the testimony. As the court broke for lunch, Omar Alkhani, who was Ms Mueller's boyfriend and was attending court with her family, got up from his seat, lent over the bar and pointed towards Mr Elsheikh as he was being escorted out. Mr Alkhani raised his voice in Arabic and said: \"He is in hell you will see him there,\" in an apparent reference to the former commander of the prison where Ms Mueller had been held before she died. Emotions continued to run high into the afternoon, with the father of Mr Sotloff - an American Israeli freelance journalist beheaded in 2014 - struggling to hold back tears on the stand. Arthur Sotloff told the court that the first ransom email he received from the kidnappers described his son as having played a prominent role in \"the US government's battle for the hearts and minds of Muslims\". In the note, the hostage takers called for the release of \"all Muslim people imprisoned directly or indirectly by Americans\" in return for the junior Sotloff's return. Arthur said he had no choice but to keep quiet as the group had demanded media silence. The Sotloffs too sent a video message to their child's captors, playing to their supposed piety by stating that Islam is a merciful religion and the Prophet Muhammad would want them to act differently. Months later, they heard their son's voice for the last time. In an apparently coerced recording, Mr Sotloff asked his family to fight for him and said \"my life lies in the hands of President Obama\". On 3 September 2014, Arthur found out by a news alert that his son had been executed in a publicly released video. He was visibly shaking when he walked off the stand and was comforted by Ms Mueller's father as they left the court. A day earlier, James Foley's mother had testified that she had at first hoped reports her son had been executed were \"some cruel joke\". She told the court: \"It just seemed too horrific.\" Mrs Foley said it only sank in when President Barack Obama confirmed on television that James had been executed. The Elsheikh trial continues and is expected to last three to four weeks.

But Hudson Swafford could never have expected what happened to him at the Masters on Friday. Hitting his second on the historic par-five 13th hole, the US golfer lined up to hit his iron shot from the fairway. He swung, connected with the ball, and the ball flew in the correct direction. However, much to Swafford\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bemusement, the head of his club flew off the end of his club, leaving the bewildered golfer holding the shaft and handle of his club. Television cameras caught the world No. 79 turning to his caddie, asking what happened with his arms aloft.

Joey and Paula Reed, the parents of former US Marine Trevor Reed, stood for hours in the cold weather in Fort Worth, holding a sign about their son and waiting for Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s motorcade to pass by in the hopes that President would stop to speak with them. The Reed family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attempt to set up a meeting with Biden ahead of the visit was declined, they said. Reed\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family stood near the road waving as Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s motorcade passed by before the President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s speech. Paula Reed, Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s mother, said she saw Biden acknowledge her from his vehicle. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat was the whole purpose of coming out here, to get his attention,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, saying it was \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 worth it. A White House official said Biden called the Reeds \u201a\u00c4\u00fato reiterate his commitment to doing everything he can to bring their son home, to staying in close touch with them through his national security team and to finding a time to meet in person.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 After the speech, reporters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including a CNN producer \u201a\u00c4\u00ec at the scene with the Reed family could hear the President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voice on the cell phone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s speaker when he called. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t imagine what you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going through,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden could be heard saying during the call. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want you to think that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not something I constantly think about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds grew emotional and stepped away from reporters for the remainder of the conversation with the President, but Paula Reed shared with reporters details of the call after it had ended. She said Biden told them he felt terrible he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with them while he was in Texas and promised his scheduler would make an appointment for the family to meet with him in Washington. Biden told them he said a rosary for Trevor on his way to Texas, according to Paula Reed. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe was just very, very apologetic that he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. Reed added that Biden also told them he \u201a\u00c4\u00fathinks of Trevor every day and that he feels horrible that he hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to bring Trevor home yet. And he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to stop.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki had told reporters that a meeting could still happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00fa(W)e are working toward setting up a meeting with his family. The President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking forward to doing that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Psaki told reporters en route to Fort Worth aboard Air Force One. Trevor Reed has been detained in Russia since 2019. He was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the \u201a\u00c4\u00falife and health\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of Russian police officers after a night of drinking. He and his family have denied the charges and US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan called the trial \u201a\u00c4\u00fatheater of the absurd.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerned the invasion of Ukraine will worsen his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fate, along with that of Paul Whelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. The Reed family, who met with Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan last December, has said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been asking for the meeting with the President for months. Shortly after Psaki said a presidential meeting was in the works, Joey Reed told CNN the family has not had any new communication with the White House. Jon Franks, a spokesman for the Reed family, said Psaki\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statements were very welcome. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are grateful they seem to have reconsidered and await details. Just a reminder that the Reeds gratefully acknowledged their meeting with NSA Sullivan when it took place back in December. They look forward to gratefully acknowledging a meeting with their President,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Franks said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe want to talk to the President and say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the only man in the world who can bring him home and you can do it today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said Tuesday before the White House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Joey Reed said he heard Monday that the meeting during Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s trip on Tuesday would not happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we were told second hand was that there wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI know that every second is planned out for the President every day, but three minutes? Three or four minutes? I think he could spare that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trevor Reed has said in recent weeks that he is coughing up blood, and his family is concerned he has tuberculosis. Joey Reed said he spoke with his son as recently as Monday and asked Trevor if he wanted to pass along a message to Biden. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have anything to say to the President. I think that they have forgotten about me,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have not (forgotten about him). We love our son and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to fight to our dying day to bring him home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Brianna Keilar on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wednesday that they spoke with Trevor again Wednesday morning. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe called us again this morning. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been sounding horrible, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coughing constantly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd then we had even worse news this morning, he called and could barely talk. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s had some sort of accident and he believes he might have broken a rib.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed also said Trevor told them he would be sent to a hospital prison on Friday to be checked and while he believed Trevor has been honest about his health, expressed uncertainty that his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s injury was an accident. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt just seems to be getting worse and worse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Whelan, a former United States Marine, was sentenced to 16 years in prison on an espionage charge he vehemently denies. Whelan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family has said in recent days that the US should not forget about him and Reed as the US discusses Russian sanctions. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are watching the impact of sanctions, expected retaliation by the Russian Federation government, and making what contingency plans we can to support him,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Paul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s brother, David Whelan wrote in a statement released late last week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPaul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wrongful detention has always been about the Russian Federation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government extracting concessions from the US government.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the Russian Federation demands the concession of sanction removal, let Paul and Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s freedom be part of the price the Russian authorities pay in return,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 David Whelan added in the statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur family will be expressing this view to members of Congress, the State Department, and the White House.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. This week, the White House has turned some of its focus to Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention of American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner has been detained in Russia after customs officials detected cannabis oil in the athlete\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s luggage at an airport near Moscow, according to the Russian Federal Customs Service. According to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the administration is working on the process to get her out of Russia. The White House, so far, has publicly declined to discuss Griner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention or their potential efforts to secure her release.

On whether this was a symbolic show of support, a Royal source indicated it was unlikely to be accidental. The 95-year-old monarch was pictured smiling warmly at the Canadian PM as he held her right hand in both of his. Justin Trudeau was visiting for talks with the UK PM about the Ukraine war. The monarch, who is also Queen of Canada, tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 February and has carried out only \"light duties\" since then, cancelling several events.

During the audience at Windsor Castle's Oak Room, Mr Trudeau was also pictured laughing as the Queen gestured towards herself. The Queen was not seen with the walking stick which she has been using recently. Asked later at a Downing Street news conference about his meeting with the monarch, Mr Trudeau said: \"She was as insightful and perspicacious as ever, very interested in what is going on, asked me all sorts of questions about Canada. \"We had a really useful - for me anyway - conversation about global events, as we always do.\" As well as this gesture of support for Ukraine at the meeting, the Queen previously made a donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal to help people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.

Sherri Papini vanished in November 2016, launching a massive search, only for the Northern California mother of two to turn up three weeks later, telling investigators she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d been kidnapped, beaten and branded. California woman accused of hoax kidnapping was driven by 'narcissistic behavior,' sheriff says The Justice Department says Papini made the whole thing up. She was arrested last Thursday and has been charged with making false statements to a law enforcement officer and mail fraud, the department said in a news release. Papini, who had been detained since her arrest, appeared before a judge via Zoom on Tuesday. US Magistrate Judge Jeremy Peterson ruled she could be released on an $120,000 bond, with certain conditions, including that her travel be limited to only one part of California, that she must receive psychiatric treatment, must surrender her passport and cannot use firearms, among other terms. The judge addressed Papini directly, warning her that if she violated those conditions, there would be further penalties. Assistant US Attorney Veronica Alegria argued against Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s release, claiming Papini is an \u201a\u00c4\u00faextreme flight risk\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and has a \u201a\u00c4\u00falengthy pattern of dishonesty.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s alleged fraudulent disappearance was not without consequences to others: It cost upward of $230,000 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facountless hours\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of manpower, according to officials. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUltimately, the investigation revealed that there was no kidnapping,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 US Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said in the DOJ news release, \u201a\u00c4\u00faand that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted based on the defendant\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conduct.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out multiples times to Michael Borges, an attorney for Papini, for comment. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s virtual court appearance, Borges said his client has no intention to flee while she awaits trial. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s husband reported her missing November 2, 2016, after she failed to pick up her kids at day care. She was found three weeks later, alone on Interstate 5 about 140 miles from home. She told police she had been kidnapped by two women who wore masks and spoke Spanish. They held her at gunpoint, she said, kept her chained in a closet and branded her. But last week, the Justice Department said Papini was actually with an ex-boyfriend in Southern California and that she caused her own injuries in support of her abduction claim. In all, the cost of the investigation borne by public safety agencies was around $150,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a conservative estimate, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said in a statement on Facebook last week. But the cost isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t only measured in dollars, Johnson said. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case and her story diverted resources from real cases with real victims. Years ago, she told police she had been abducted, beaten and branded. Now she's charged with making it all up \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the sheriff said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faFinally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faall of law enforcement in Shasta (County) was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling (of) this case.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case cost the public in other ways, too. According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, between 2017 and 2021, Papini received $30,000 from the California Victim Compensation Board, which assists and reimburses victims of violent crimes for \u201a\u00c4\u00facrime-related expenses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 they suffer. In Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case, the affidavit says, $1,000 was used so Papini could buy blinds for her home and nearly $2,000 were paid to the ambulance provider who transported Papini after she was found. The rest of the money were payments for Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s therapy and treatment for anxiety and post-traumatic stress stemming from her supposed kidnapping. Then, there was the GoFundMe campaign that allegedly netted just over $49,000. Per the affidavit, donors were told the funds would be used to \u201a\u00c4\u00fafind and bring Sherri home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In fact, federal prosecutors say, more than $30,000 was withdrawn by a family member from the campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bank account and more than $11,000 was used to pay off the family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s personal credit cards. The remaining amount was \u201a\u00c4\u00faspent on personal expenses,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the affidavit says. A GoFundMe spokesperson told CNN the fundraiser has been removed from the platform and has not been actively receiving donations since 2016. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with law enforcement to assist with their ongoing investigation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the spokesperson said. Regarding the GoFundMe campaign, family spokesman Chris Thomas referred questions to Borges, the attorney for Papini.

The measure comes as the country grapples with some of the worst housing affordability issues in the world. Prices have jumped more than 20%, pushing the average home in Canada to nearly C$817,000 ($650,000; \u00a3495,000) -  more than nine times household income. But industry analysts say it's not clear a ban on foreign buyers will address the problem. Data on purchases by foreign buyers in Canada is limited, but research suggests they amount for a small fraction of the market. \"I don't think\u00a0it's going to have a huge\u00a0impact,\" said Ben Myers, president of advisory firm Bullpenn Research & Consulting in Toronto, who found foreigners accounted for just 1% of purchases in 2020, down from 9% in 2015 and 2016. \"It's a fairly low number and let's face it, the people that really want to buy ... are going to find alternative ways to do it.\" Mr Myers said the soaring housing costs reflect strong population growth and a shortage of supply, due in part to rules that restrict development. The issues have worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers in Canada and elsewhere slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, lowering borrowing costs and boosting demand even further. The moves have fuelled the soaring housing prices seen in many markets around the world, but in Canada the disconnect between home prices and incomes is one of the most dramatic, according to OECD data. Mr Trudeau pledged to tackle housing affordability during his campaign for election last year. In addition to the temporary ban on foreign buyers, the budget proposal his government unveiled on Thursday sets aside billions to spur new construction and proposes new programmes, such as a tax-free savings account for first-time buyers. This video can not be played Why it takes 30 years to buy a house in Canada Mr Trudeau has also discussed banning certain bidding processes that favour investors, who by some measures have accounted for about one in five homes purchased in Canada since 2014. The proposed ban on foreign buyers would exempt permanent residents and foreign students and workers, as well as those buying their primary residence. The proposal builds on actions such as special taxes that some parts of Canada have already taken against out-of-town and foreign buyers. In Ontario, for example, provincial Premier Doug Ford recently announced plans to raise an existing tax on foreign buyers from 15% to 20% and expand it beyond Toronto to the entire province. While foreign purchases are not the driver of the affordability issues, taxing them at least captures revenue that can be re-deployed to address such problems, said Steve Pomeroy, head of Focus Consulting, a housing policy firm. \"If you ban them, you don't really have much of an impact on suppressing rising home prices and you give up the revenue,\" he said. New Zealand introduced a similar measure banning foreign buyers in 2018. \"It's good politics because it's easy to blame a victim that nobody cares about,\" Mr Pomeroy added. \"I don't think it will have much of an impact.\" Paul Kershaw, professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, also said he saw little in  Mr Trudeau's proposal likely to slow price increases or significantly address affordability. \"It's not clear the housing measures will be sufficient to break Canada's addiction to high and rising home prices,\" he said, noting that for existing homeowners, the high prices help amass wealth. Mr Pomeroy said he does expect price appreciation to slow in coming months, as the central bank raises interest rates. The Canadian housing market is particularly susceptible to such moves, since many buyers rely on five-year mortgages rather than the long-term ones common in the US and UK. But higher interest rates will only make it less affordable for prospective buyers trying to break into the market, he warned. Mr Myers said over the long-term, he expects hot markets such as Toronto and Vancouver to become dominated by renters, as regular buyers get priced out of the market, unless politicians address supply. But Mr Pomeroy said high development costs means that adding supply will not necessarily reduce prices, unless the additions are dramatic. \"Unless you've got born into the right family ... the prospects for young buyers are quite dim,\" he said.

Has he done permanent damage to his image and career, and what might happen next? As the Oscars ended on Sunday night, Will Smith may have hoped he had nipped the fallout from his slap in the bud. His tearful best actor acceptance speech, in which he apologised to the Academy and his fellow nominees and tried to frame himself as a \"defender of his family\", received a standing ovation. He later made a show of posing and dancing with his best actor statuette at the after-show party in classic Big Willie style, as if nothing had happened. Or as if he was relieved to have ridden out the storm. But when he woke the next morning, the storm hadn't passed. It only intensified as people took stock of his violent behaviour in the cold light of day. \"It is kind of crazy to think that this one incident could wipe away so many decades of goodwill,\" says The Wrap editor-in-chief Sharon Waxman. \"But it was so public, it was so outside of the box. One agent we talked to called it a 'stunning act of narcissism'. The movie star brand for Will Smith is badly tarnished.\" Her website has published an article asking film industry insiders if Smith's career is \"mortally wounded\". \"The conclusion is, yeah,\" Waxman says. \"'Mortally wounded' is a quote, that's what one of the agents we talked to called it, and said he's kind of done as an A-list movie star. \"The idea that people still relate to Will Smith and feel like he's somebody they want to look up to, and they want to admire, and pretend that - hey, that could be me up there on the screen - there's a real sense that that relatability has been taken away with this gesture.\" Kim Masters, editor-at-large of the Hollywood Reporter, agrees Smith - known for hits like Men In Black, Independence Day and Bad Boys - has done huge damage to his image. \"He's built a persona over many, many years, and this was a complete break from that persona,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"People were absolutely shocked by his comportment and subsequently a rather peculiar acceptance speech and then dancing as if he had not a care in the world at the Vanity Fair party. So this is a big change of what people know and expect from Will Smith.\" The 53-year-old star had no history of causing trouble and was known to be generous with fellow cast members, she added. \"But nonetheless, many people have said they can't look at him the same again.\" What can we expect from him in the coming months? There may be charity work, a public announcement of therapy or anger management, and the obligatory confessional interview - perhaps even on his family's Facebook chat show Red Table Talk. That is where he and wife Jada Pinkett Smith came clean about their relationship issues in 2020, which is the closest he has come to scandal in the past. It is also where Pinkett Smith opened up about her alopecia - the hair loss condition that was at the nub of her husband's Oscars outburst - and where Kevin Hart talked about quitting as host of the 2019 Oscars. Smith also has a number of films in the pipeline that have now been thrown into uncertainty. They include Bad Boys 4, Bright 2 and Apple's Emancipation, in which he plays a runaway slave. \"A big indicator of how tarnished Will Smith's reputation is [will come] when we see what Apple decides to do with this movie,\" Waxman says. \"Everybody thought it would come out the second half of the year and be in contention for awards for next year, and we don't know what Apple's going to do. \"If they decide to push it [back], I think that'll give you some strong sense of, they don't want to be out in the marketplace with Will Smith this year.\" Other Hollywood stars who have fallen from grace may offer clues about what comes next, even if the circumstances of their behaviour differ. Johnny Depp lost his role in the third Fantastic Beasts film after losing a libel case over a newspaper article that called him a wife beater. But he kept his Christian Dior adverts and a die-hard fanbase who have continued to support him at every turn. He has also just been cast in his first film since the libel trial, a French production in which he will play Louis XV. Mel Gibson has been hit by scandal more than once, admitting a drunken anti-Semitic outburst in 2006, and in 2010 when leaked tapes emerged of a tirade including racist insults against his then-girlfriend, who accused him of physical abuse. He was eventually welcomed back by Hollywood - and was nominated for an Oscar in 2017. Smith's career may be wounded but, if he can reconcile with Hollywood, it's not necessarily over. The final words of his acceptance speech on Sunday were: \"I hope the Academy invites me back.\" The chances of him being asked to present the best actress award at the 2023 Oscars - as the previous year's best actor winner would traditionally do - appear slim. But it's also unlikely that he will be forced to hand back the golden statuette he won on Sunday. Oscars organisers introduced a new code of conduct in 2017 in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Harvey Weinstein and Roman Polanski were expelled from the Academy as a result, but even they were not stripped of their Oscars. Former ceremony host Whoopi Goldberg, who is one of three governors in the Academy's acting branch, said last week: \"We're not going to take that Oscar from him. \"There will be consequences, I'm sure, but I don't think that's what they're going to do, particularly because Chris [Rock] said, 'Listen, I'm not pressing any charges.'\" Police did not arrest Smith after consulting Rock on the night, but have said they could file a report at a later date if the comedian changes his mind. The Academy started disciplinary proceedings against Smith last week, with expulsion and suspension among the possible punishments. But Smith took matters into his own hands on Friday when he resigned his membership. Despite that, Academy bosses said their disciplinary proceedings would continue and will discuss any further action on 18 April. In his resignation letter, the actor hinted that he wants to move forward, saying he is \"committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason\". But he also made clear that the gravity of his actions has now fully sunk in, acknowledging how \"shocking, painful and inexcusable\" they were.

Another bill, which requires K-12 students to use bathrooms designated for their biological sex, included a last-hour amendment Thursday critics have compared to similar legislation in Florida dubbed the \u201a\u00c4\u00faDon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 law. It would ban classroom discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools. The state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Representatives also approved SB 184, which would make it a class C felony for medical professionals to provide gender-affirming care \u201a\u00c4\u00ec such as hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender-reassignment surgery \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to people 18 and younger. Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bills into law Friday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are very real challenges facing our young people, especially with today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s societal pressures and modern culture. I believe very strongly that if the Good Lord made you a boy, you are a boy, and if he made you a girl, you are a girl. We should especially protect our children from these radical, life-altering drugs and surgeries when they are at such a vulnerable stage in life. Instead, let us all focus on helping them to properly develop into the adults God intended them to be,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, according to a statement from her press office.

The GOP-led Senate passed the bill 24-6 in February, and it will become law 30 days after the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signature. Alabama would be the latest state to enact such a measure. Last year, Republican lawmakers in Arkansas overrode a veto from their governor to put their own health care ban on the books, and Tennessee and Arizona have passed similar bans. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued Arkansas over its ban last year, and in July, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the law. The ACLU, the ACLU of Alabama and other legal advocacy groups announced plans to file a legal challenge to the bill. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur representatives have been hearing from medical experts, parents, transgender youth, and other advocates for the past three years in an attempt to stop this harmful bill from passing. But despite this strong opposition, the Legislature seems determined to move ahead with this shameful effort to prevent parents and kids from deciding the best course of treatment for themselves,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Kaitlin Welborn, staff attorney for the ACLU of Alabama. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the state moves forward in passing this unconstitutional bill, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll see them in court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Later, the legislature passed a bill requiring K-12 students to use bathrooms designated for their biological sex.

After the bill was sent back to the House for a concurrence vote, the amendment was adopted Thursday night following a 70-26 vote. The bill now heads to Ivey for final approval, according to Julie Saint, supervisor for enrolling and engrossing for the Alabama House of Representatives. Opponents of the measure condemned its passage, with the ACLU of Alabama saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt also invokes legislation similar to Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s controversial \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 bill by banning classroom instruction or discussion of gender identity in public elementary schools.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The legislation violates the US Constitution and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, the ACLU said.

It is often tempting to look upon Vladimir Putin as the millennium bug in a human and deadly form. The Russian president rose to power on 31 December 1999, as the world held its breath that computers would go into meltdown when the clock struck midnight, unable to process the change from 1999 to 2000. In the 20 years since, Putin has been trying to engineer a different kind of global system malfunction, the destruction of the liberal international order. The former KGB spymaster wanted to turn back the clock: to revive Russia's tsarist greatness and to restore the might and menace of the Soviet Union prior to its break-up in 1991. This Russian revanchist has become the most disruptive international leader of the 21st Century, the mastermind behind so much misery from Chechnya to Crimea, from Syria to the cathedral city of Salisbury. He has sought - successfully at times - to redraw the map of Europe. He has tried - successfully at times - to immobilise the United Nations. He has been determined - successfully at times - to weaken America, and hasten its division and decline. Putin came to power at a moment of western hubris. The United States was the sole superpower in a unipolar world. Francis Fukuyama's End of History thesis, proclaiming the triumph of liberal democracy, was widely accepted. Some economists even peddled the theory that recessions would be no more, partly because of the productivity gains of the new digital economy. It was also thought that globalisation, and the interdependence it wrought, would stop major economic powers fighting wars. The same utopianism attached itself to the internet, which was seen overwhelmingly as a force for global good. In the early days especially, the same misplaced optimism and wishful thinking coloured the west's approach to Putin - a figure, it is now obvious, who was trying to buck history and thwart democratisation, however many lives were lost in the process. Successive US presidents have played into his hands. Bill Clinton, the occupant of the White House when Putin came to power, handed this ultra-nationalist a popular grievance by pushing for the expansion of Nato right up to Russia's borders. As George F Kennan, the famed architect of America's Cold War strategy of containment, warned at the time: \"Expanding Nato would be the most fateful error of America policy in the entire post-Cold War era.\" George W Bush completely misjudged his Russian counterpart. \"I looked the man in the eye,\" Bush famously said after their first meeting in Slovenia in 2001. \"I found him very straightforward and trustworthy\u2026 I was able to get a sense of his soul.\" Bush mistakenly thought he could mount a charm offensive with Putin, and gently cajole him further down the democratic path. But even though Bush visited Russia more than any other country - including, as a personal favour, two trips in 2002 to Putin's home city, St Petersburg - the Russian leader was already displaying dangerously despotic tendencies. In 2008, Bush's final year as president, Putin invaded Georgia - what he called a \"peace enforcement operation\". The Kremlin argued then - and has continued to argue ever since - that it was hypocritical for Washington to complain about this violation of international law after Bush had invaded Iraq. Barack Obama sought to reframe US-Russian relations. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, even handed her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov a mock reset button (which was mistakenly labelled with the Russian word for \"overloaded\"). But Putin knew that America, after its long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, no longer wanted to police the world. When Obama refused in 2013 to enforce his red-line warning against Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator used chemical weapons against his own people, Putin saw a green light. By helping Assad carry out his murderous war, he extended Moscow's sphere of influence in the Middle East when the United States wanted to extract itself from the region. The following year, he annexed Crimea, and established a foothold in eastern Ukraine. Despite being told by Obama to \"cut it out,\" Putin even sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the hope that Hillary Clinton, a long-time nemesis, would be defeated and that Donald Trump, a long-time fan boy, would win. The New York property tycoon made no secret of his admiration for Putin, a sycophantic approach that seems to have further emboldened the Russian president. Much to Moscow's delight, Trump publicly criticised Nato, weakened the US post-war alliance system and became such a polarising figure that he left America more politically divided than at any time since the Civil War. Arguably, then, you have to reach back 30 years to find a US leader whose approach to the Kremlin has stood the test of time. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, George Herbert Walker Bush resisted the temptation to rejoice in America's Cold War victory - much to the astonishment of the White House press pack, he refused to travel to Berlin for a victory lap - knowing that it would bolster hardliners in the Politburo and military seeking to oust Mikhail Gorbachev. That magnanimity in victory helped when it came to bringing about the reunification of Germany, which was arguably Bush's greatest foreign policy success. Putin is obviously a more formidable adversary, harder to deal with than even Leonid Brezhnev or Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet premier during the Cuban Missile Crisis. But since the turn of the century no US president has truly had his measure. Joe Biden, like George Herbert Walker Bush, is a Cold War warrior, who has dedicated his presidency to defending democracy at home and abroad. Seeking to re-establish America's traditional post-war role as the leader of the free world, he has sought to mobilise the international community, offered military aid to Ukraine and adopted the toughest sanction regime ever targeted against Putin. As Russian forces amassed at the border, he also shared US intelligence showing that Putin had decided to invade, in ways that sought to disrupt the Kremlin's usual misinformation campaigns and false flag operations. His State of the Union address became a rallying cry. \"Freedom will always triumph over tyranny,\" he said. And while Biden does not speak with the clarity or force of a Kennedy or a Reagan, it was nonetheless a significant speech. What's been striking since the Russian invasion started, however, has been the assertion of forceful presidential leadership from elsewhere. Volodymyr Zelensky has been lauded and lionised, as he has continued this extraordinary personal journey from comedian to Churchillian colossus. In Brussels, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has been another commanding presence. This former German politician has been a driving force behind the decision, for the first time in EU history, to finance and purchase weapons for a nation under attack, a commitment that includes not just ammunition but fighter jets as well. Her compatriot, the new Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, has also shown more resolve in dealing with Putin than his predecessor Angela Merkel. At warp speed, he has overturned decades of post-Cold War German foreign policy, an approach so often predicated on caution and timidity towards the Russian leader. Berlin has sent anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine (ending the policy of not sending weapons to active war zones), halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, withdrawn its opposition to blocking Russia from the SWIFT international payments system, and even committed to spending 2% of its GDP on defence spending. The biggest assault on a European state since World War Two has stiffened European resolve. But so, too, it seems has the relative weakness of America. Mindful of the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan and possibility of a Trump 2.0 presidency, European leaders seem to have realised that they can no longer lean so heavily on Washington to defend democracy in this hour of maximum peril. Leadership of the free world has, in this crisis, become a common endeavour. Even since the end of the Cold War, Washington has been calling upon European nations to do more to police its own neighbourhood, something they failed to do when the break-up of the former Yugoslavia sparked the Bosnian war. Historians may well conclude that it took a combination of Putin's aggressiveness, America's fragility, Ukraine's heroic resolve and the fear that Europe's post-war stability is truly on the line to finally make that happen. This video can not be played Watch: What Americans think of Biden's Ukraine response It would be naive to be swept away by the romanticism of Zelensky's speeches or to succumb to the dopamine high of watching the seizure of Russian-owned super-yachts unfold on social media. Putin is intensifying the war. But the last week has sent a message to Moscow - and to Beijing as well - that the post-war international order still continues to function, despite the deployment of the Russian war machine to bring about its collapse. Just as history never ended, nor has liberal democracy. As Joe Biden put it in his State of the Union, during a passage in which rhetoric served also as sober analysis: Putin \"thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met a wall of resistance he never imagined\". Nick Bryant is the author of When America Stopped Being Great: a history of the present.

The New York attorney general opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans. Mr Trump and his family have denied wrongdoing and the former president has called the inquiry a \"witch hunt\". In February, a judge ruled that Mr Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr, 44, and daughter Ivanka Trump, 40, must answer questions under oath in the New York investigation into their business practices. They appealed the order to appear but did not object to a separate part of the ruling that the former president comply with a subpoena \"seeking documents and information\". Those were meant to be produced by 31 March. In court documents filed on Thursday, the New York attorney general said Mr Trump has not produced the requested documents and has raised objections \"based on grounds such as overbreadth, burden, and lack of particularity\". \"The judge's order was crystal clear: Donald J Trump must comply with our subpoena and turn over relevant documents to my office,\" Ms James said in a statement. Ms James has repeatedly blamed Mr Trump for creating unnecessary delays in the legal process. Mr Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, said in a statement sent to Reuters that: \"We are prepared to adamantly oppose the frivolous and baseless motion filed by the attorney general's office. \"Our client has consistently complied with the many discovery requests served by the attorney general's office over the years.\" The civil case is separate to a Manhattan criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's practices.

US President Joe Biden said the move targeted \"the main artery of Russia's economy\". Energy exports are a vital source of revenue for Russia but the move is also likely to impact Western consumers. Major brands have meanwhile continued to pull out of Russia, with McDonald's and Coca-Cola the latest to leave. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on energy. It is the world's third-biggest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia and the US. Before the measures were announced, Russia warned of \"catastrophic\" consequences for the global economy and said it might close its main gas pipeline to Germany. On the ground in Ukraine, civilians have been evacuated from two under-attack areas while the US has said up to 4,000 Russian troops may have been killed in the conflict. The conflict has already sent petrol prices to record highs in the US and the UK and experts warn they could go even higher. However, Venezuela could increase its oil production to help replace Russian oil. Reinaldo Quintero, president of the association that represents Venezuelan oil companies told the BBC that the country could potentially raise its production levels by 400,000 barrels a day. \"I think we can reach 1.2 million barrels per day with the infrastructure we have right now at this moment. So that will make us able to supply the need, some of the need, to the North American market,\" he said. President Biden's announcement followed pressure from both sides of the US political divide to do more to target the Russian economy. \"We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,\" he said. \"That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to [President Vladimir] Putin.\" Mr Biden admitted the move was \"not without cost at home,\" adding the decision was taken \"in close consultation\" with allies. In a similar move, the UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, accepted that the move would not hit Russia immediately but added \"what it will do is add to the pressure we're already seeing on Russia and don't forget that the economic impact of the sanctions that the UK has led has been extreme\". About 8% of US oil and refined product imports come from Russia, while Russia makes up about 6% of the UK's oil imports. By contrast, the EU is much more reliant on Russian energy, so the bloc's response stopped short of a ban. The European Commission said it would switch to alternative supplies and expand clean energy faster to fill the shortfall, with the aim of making Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels \"well before 2030\". This video can not be played Watch: Five times Russians have stood up for Ukraine \"We're not standing here to say this is going to be in any way easy,\" said the European Commission's Vice-President Frans Timmermans. \"But I am also deeply convinced that even if it's not easy, even if it's very hard, it's something we need to do, because now it's also intimately linked to our security.\" Russia later announced plans to ban the exports of certain commodities and raw materials. The details are still to be worked out, but Russia is a major exporter of grain and metals. Even countries with low Russian energy imports are set to feel the impact as the measures are likely to boost already high wholesale prices. Inflation is soaring in the US, EU and the UK, adding to the pressure on households. The move adds to a long list of economic sanctions imposed against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine - the central bank has had its assets frozen, some Russian banks have been cut off from global payment networks and Germany suspended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have transported more gas from Russia to Germany. But energy sales have continued to provide a source of cash despite the other financial restrictions. Russia says it may cut gas supplies if oil blocked How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Those in captivity were forced to sing a parody of the Eagles' pop song \"Hotel California\" retitled \"Hotel Osama\", Nicolas H\u00e9nin said. It contained the lines: \"you will never leave/if you try, you will die\". Mr H\u00e9nin was the latest witness in the trial of El Shafee Elsheikh. The IS militant cell was known as the Beatles because of their British accents. An alleged member of the militant cell known as \"Jihadi George,\" Mr Elsheikh, 33, is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US, accused of kidnapping and conspiracy to murder. The court on Wednesday heard from Mr H\u00e9nin, who was abducted in June 2013 while working in Raqqa, Syria. He was blindfolded by men with AK-47s in the middle of the day and driven out of town, he said. When the blindfold was removed, he found himself alone in a cell, and would later come into contact with several other hostages. Mr H\u00e9nin testified that he witnessed brutal torture and was himself beaten until unconscious by men believed to be the so-called Beatles. The group have been linked to some 27 abductions and the murders of four Americans - journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. Prosecutors in the case argue that Mr Elsheikh was deeply involved in making ransom demands from the families of hostages for the group, and involved in the executions they carried out. He is also charged with conspiring in the deaths of the British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. The defence, however, have said that the Sudanese-born Londoner was not part of the group and merely \"a simple Isis fighter\". Mr H\u00e9nin said that he saw Mr Haines, who was starved and tortured so much that he \"at first sight looked like somebody at a Nazi concentration camp\", and Mr Foley, who was weak from \"intense torture\" and had had his ribs broken. Another captive, the Danish journalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, was \"a shadow of a man... so badly tortured that he was mentally and physically diminished\". Wounds on his wrists were \"so deep you could see his bones\", Mr H\u00e9nin said. He also encountered Ms Mueller, Mr Sotloff and Mr Kassig during his captivity, the Frenchman said. They arrived at various point during his detainment, he said, and were at one point held together in a small underground room they nicknamed \"the Dungeon\". Mr H\u00e9nin was released in April 2014, but others were not so lucky. Several family members of victims have testified about email exchanges with the captors as part of the prosecution's case. Earlier on Wednesday, the father of Peter Kassig recounted receiving a letter from his son saying he \"knew it was his time\", predicting his death before he was executed. Mr Elsheikh - on Wednesday wearing a white shirt and black face mask - sat back in his chair and listened intently to Mr Kassig's testimony, cocking his head slightly to look at the government's evidence, and making no eye contact with the witness. He took extensive notes when Mr H\u00e9nin testified. The trial continues, with as many as 50 witnesses expected.

Another bill, which requires K-12 students to use bathrooms designated for their biological sex, included a last-hour amendment Thursday critics have compared to similar legislation in Florida dubbed the \u201a\u00c4\u00faDon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 law. It would ban classroom discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools. The state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Representatives also approved SB 184, which would make it a class C felony for medical professionals to provide gender-affirming care \u201a\u00c4\u00ec such as hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender-reassignment surgery \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to people 18 and younger. Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bills into law Friday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are very real challenges facing our young people, especially with today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s societal pressures and modern culture. I believe very strongly that if the Good Lord made you a boy, you are a boy, and if he made you a girl, you are a girl.

Instead, let us all focus on helping them to properly develop into the adults God intended them to be,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, according to a statement from her press office.

The GOP-led Senate passed the bill 24-6 in February, and it will become law 30 days after the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signature. Alabama would be the latest state to enact such a measure. Last year, Republican lawmakers in Arkansas overrode a veto from their governor to put their own health care ban on the books, and Tennessee and Arizona have passed similar bans. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued Arkansas over its ban last year, and in July, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the law. The ACLU, the ACLU of Alabama and other legal advocacy groups announced plans to file a legal challenge to the bill. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur representatives have been hearing from medical experts, parents, transgender youth, and other advocates for the past three years in an attempt to stop this harmful bill from passing.

After the bill was sent back to the House for a concurrence vote, the amendment was adopted Thursday night following a 70-26 vote. The bill now heads to Ivey for final approval, according to Julie Saint, supervisor for enrolling and engrossing for the Alabama House of Representatives.

The 95-year-old monarch was pictured smiling warmly at the Canadian PM as he held her right hand in both of his. Justin Trudeau was visiting for talks with the UK PM about the Ukraine war. The monarch, who is also Queen of Canada, tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 February and has carried out only \"light duties\" since then, cancelling several events.

During the audience at Windsor Castle's Oak Room, Mr Trudeau was also pictured laughing as the Queen gestured towards herself. The Queen was not seen with the walking stick which she has been using recently. Asked later at a Downing Street news conference about his meeting with the monarch, Mr Trudeau said: \"She was as insightful and perspicacious as ever, very interested in what is going on, asked me all sorts of questions about Canada. \"We had a really useful - for me anyway - conversation about global events, as we always do.\" As well as this gesture of support for Ukraine at the meeting, the Queen previously made a donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal to help people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAfter 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians \u201a\u00c4\u00fahostage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration. Ukrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing \u201a\u00c4\u00fachildren, women and the elderly\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 out of the city, and have launched an attack \u201a\u00c4\u00faprecisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Joint Forces Operation said. CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response. A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been \u201a\u00c4\u00faisolated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it \u201a\u00c4\u00fain any significant way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days. Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe main issue today remains humanitarian aid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video. Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are \u201a\u00c4\u00faforced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, adding that Moscow is preventing \u201a\u00c4\u00fahumanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces \u201a\u00c4\u00faviolated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance in northern Ukraine. That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing \u201a\u00c4\u00faseveral civilians\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fasidelines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe will fight to the end,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s famous wartime speech. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrengthen the sanctions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a terrorist state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. Zelensky's heroism is coming up against Western red lines \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stoltenberg. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe situation could spiral out of control,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe other half largely from inside Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA little bit more than 70\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles have been fired from Belarus, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faonly a half dozen or so\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the measure, which would bar teachers from teaching these topics to children under 10 years old. Critics say the bill will isolate LGBT youth. Proponents say it is about empowering parents on education issues. Activists have dubbed it the Don't Say Gay bill. It is officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Bill. The Republican-backed legislation passed on Tuesday. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics \"when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\". White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday decried the passing of \"hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students\". President Joe Biden and his administration are \"with LGBTQI+ students everywhere\", she wrote on Twitter. State laws that ban or constrain the discussion of LGBT life in classrooms - sometimes called \"no promo homo\" laws by critics - are not uncommon. Four US states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas - currently have laws on the books that explicitly prohibit or limit sex education to heterosexual activity. The Florida bill also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Representative Joe Harding, who sponsored the bill in Florida's statehouse, has said that the bill is simply about \"empowering parents\". Critics say that vague language in the law could result in teachers and students being prevented from discussing their lives even outside the classroom. \"This is really about making it impossible for LGBT young people to speak for themselves,\" said Nadine Smith, the executive director of advocacy group Equality Florida. Todd and Jeff Delmay - one of the first same-sex couples to get married in Florida - say this bill would make it impossible for their 11-year-old son Blake to talk freely about his dads. \"We have fought and won these battles to adopt children and to be a family and to be together,\" Todd told the BBC. \"And they are now trying to find every way in which they can erase us and our families.\" And the couple warned the bill could marginalise LGBT youth as they  come to terms with their identity. \"A child's need for acceptance in a safe space should always take precedence over some parents' belief,\" Todd said, adding that legal challenges were already under way. The Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative group that supports the bill, said in a statement last week that it was \"necessary because government schools in the US have become ideological, political and are more interested in shaping a child's politics and sexual inclinations than they are in teaching academics of reading, writing, math, and education\". Governor DeSantis - widely regarded as a possible 2024 White House contender - endorsed the bill last month, saying it was part of a wider effort to make the education system \"transparent\" to parents. The Florida bill is part of a fierce debate taking place across the US over children's education, how schools operate and what they teach. Why are certain books being banned in US?

Another bill, which requires K-12 students to use bathrooms designated for their biological sex, included a last-hour amendment Thursday critics have compared to similar legislation in Florida dubbed the \u201a\u00c4\u00faDon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 law. It would ban classroom discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools. The state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Representatives also approved SB 184, which would make it a class C felony for medical professionals to provide gender-affirming care \u201a\u00c4\u00ec such as hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender-reassignment surgery \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to people 18 and younger. Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bills into law Friday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are very real challenges facing our young people, especially with today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s societal pressures and modern culture. I believe very strongly that if the Good Lord made you a boy, you are a boy, and if he made you a girl, you are a girl. We should especially protect our children from these radical, life-altering drugs and surgeries when they are at such a vulnerable stage in life. Instead, let us all focus on helping them to properly develop into the adults God intended them to be,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, according to a statement from her press office. Senate Bill 184 states medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care could face up to 10 years in prison. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe decision to pursue a course of hormonal and surgical interventions to address a discordance between the individual\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sex and sense of identity should not be presented to or determined for minors who are incapable of comprehending the negative implications and life-course difficulties attending to these interventions,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the bill reads. Book bans move to center stage in the red-state education wars The legislation would also make it a violation for public or private school officials, such as teachers, principals, nurses and counselors to encourage a minor to withhold from their parent or guardian \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe fact that the minor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s perception of his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with the minor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sex.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The bill, dubbed the Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, passed the Republican-controlled House following a 66-28 vote, according to the state legislature\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s website. The GOP-led Senate passed the bill 24-6 in February, and it will become law 30 days after the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signature. Alabama would be the latest state to enact such a measure. Last year, Republican lawmakers in Arkansas overrode a veto from their governor to put their own health care ban on the books, and Tennessee and Arizona have passed similar bans. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued Arkansas over its ban last year, and in July, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the law. The ACLU, the ACLU of Alabama and other legal advocacy groups announced plans to file a legal challenge to the bill. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur representatives have been hearing from medical experts, parents, transgender youth, and other advocates for the past three years in an attempt to stop this harmful bill from passing. But despite this strong opposition, the Legislature seems determined to move ahead with this shameful effort to prevent parents and kids from deciding the best course of treatment for themselves,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Kaitlin Welborn, staff attorney for the ACLU of Alabama. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the state moves forward in passing this unconstitutional bill, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll see them in court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Later, the legislature passed a bill requiring K-12 students to use bathrooms designated for their biological sex.

Attorney General Letitia James requested he be fined $10,000 (\u00a37,650) per day until he complies. A judge previously ordered Mr Trump to provide the files as part of Ms James's probe into the Trump Organization. The former president's lawyer called the motion \"frivolous\". The New York attorney general opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans. Mr Trump and his family have denied wrongdoing and the former president has called the inquiry a \"witch hunt\". In February, a judge ruled that Mr Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr, 44, and daughter Ivanka Trump, 40, must answer questions under oath in the New York investigation into their business practices. They appealed the order to appear but did not object to a separate part of the ruling that the former president comply with a subpoena \"seeking documents and information\". Those were meant to be produced by 31 March. In court documents filed on Thursday, the New York attorney general said Mr Trump has not produced the requested documents and has raised objections \"based on grounds such as overbreadth, burden, and lack of particularity\". \"The judge's order was crystal clear: Donald J Trump must comply with our subpoena and turn over relevant documents to my office,\" Ms James said in a statement. Ms James has repeatedly blamed Mr Trump for creating unnecessary delays in the legal process. Mr Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, said in a statement sent to Reuters that: \"We are prepared to adamantly oppose the frivolous and baseless motion filed by the attorney general's office. \"Our client has consistently complied with the many discovery requests served by the attorney general's office over the years.\" The civil case is separate to a Manhattan criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's practices.

Earlier this week, a ProPublica report revealed Mr Thomas failed to disclose trips he took with real estate mogul Harlan Crow almost every year over the course of two decades, despite being required to file annual disclosures of gifts. In a statement on Friday, Mr Thomas said that he had been told by colleagues and others that \"this sort of personal hospitality\" did not need to be formally disclosed. Mr Thomas is one of nine justices on the Supreme Court serving lifetime appointments after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. Here is a look at the conservative justice and his eight colleagues who sit on the bench, including the Supreme Court's most recent member, Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal chosen by President Joe Biden last year. Jackson's appointment has not altered the 6-3 conservative majority on the court. On the court since: 23 October 1991 How he got to the court: Thomas was born in a small town in Georgia, and was one of the few African-Americans in attendance during a short stint in seminary and then at Holy Cross College. But unlike Justice Sotomayor, those experiences made him distrustful of affirmative action policies. After finishing Yale Law, he worked in Missouri government and in Washington DC before being named chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency that responds to discrimination claims in the workplace. After a bruising confirmation hearing - in which a former employee accused him of sexual harassment - Thomas was narrowly confirmed to Supreme Court, at the relatively young age of 43. Who is he as a justice? Thomas' originalism is exacting, including a disregard for stare decisis, respect for prior court rulings and precedence. Thomas has also not asked a question during oral arguments in nine years. He has previously said he doesn't care for the question-heavy arguments, sometimes already drafting opinions based on written briefs before any lawyer gets up to argue. Thomas often files entirely separate dissents rarely joined by others, but Coyle says he is influential in other ways, including during conferences only justices attend, and in \"difficult decisions\" in areas that don't get a lot of press - like intellectual property and tax law. Thomas replaced the first African-American justice on the court - Thurgood Marshall. On the court since: 3 October 2022 How she got to the court: The first black woman to sit on the court in its 233-year history is also the first justice since 1967 to come to the court with extensive experience as a criminal defence attorney. Before the US Supreme Court, the Washington DC native served on the influential US court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. Ms Jackson has said she has a \"methodology\" to deciding cases but not an overarching philosophy.\u00a0Some conservatives have accused her of being \"soft\" on criminals, pointing to her experience as a public defender and willingness as a federal judge to issue prison sentences below federal guidelines. Her confirmation came after President Biden pledged during his presidential campaign to appoint a black woman to the top court. On the court since: 31 January 2006 How he got to the court: Alito grew up in New Jersey in an Italian immigrant family. While at Princeton University, he was involved in conservative and libertarian groups, as well as the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps. After Yale law school, he was a prosecutor in New Jersey and served in the Reagan administration in the justice department, including as assistant to the solicitor general, where he argued before the Supreme Court. President George HW Bush named him to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1990, where he stayed until his nomination to The Supreme Court. Who is he as a justice? Alito is a conservative justice, but one who does not hew as often to originalism as fellow conservatives Scalia and Thomas. He is not always talkative in oral arguments  but his questions are sharp, aiming to pick apart an argument's logic. Alito has a low public profile despite being a large part of the court's rightward shift on business, campaign finance and racial issues over the past decade. The former prosecutor has been \"very pro-government\" in criminal cases, Coyle says, and has shown less willingness than his conservative colleagues to protect free speech in cases where it is harmful or hateful. On the court since: 7 August 2010 How she got to the court: Kagan grew up in New York City. At the age of 12, she convinced her rabbi to hold the synagogue's first formal bat mitzvah, the rite of passage for young women. After law school at Harvard, she clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. After a successful stint as the first female dean of Harvard Law School, she was briefly US solicitor general - the federal government's top representative at the US Supreme Court, before being nominated by President Barack Obama for the high court. Who is she as a justice? Kagan is the first justice in decades not to previously serve as a judge. She is part of the court's left-leaning wing, but has been the author of many of recent unanimous or near unanimous decisions. Her writing is often easy for a layperson to understand without sacrificing legal analysis, and she is an aggressive questioner during oral arguments. Kagan first took her seat at the bench at the age of 50 and could potentially be a force on the court for decades. Lithwick says Kagan is \"much more inscrutable\" on issues than other recent additions to the court. \"She's very close to the vest,\" she says. On the court since: 29 September 2005 How he got to the court: Born in New York and raised in Indiana, Roberts attended a boarding school as a teenager but also spent summers working in a steel mill. After considering becoming a historian at Harvard, he went to law school there instead, eventually clerking for then-Associate Justice Rehnquist. He spent many years as a lawyer in the Reagan administration then entered private practice, arguing before the high court and serving as one of several legal advisers to George W Bush in the Florida presidential recount case. Originally nominated to fill the spot left by retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Roberts was re-nominated for the chief justice position after Chief Justice Rehnquist died between terms, and his nomination was fast-tracked. Who is he as a justice: A conservative justice, Roberts is the third-youngest Chief Justice in the court's history, confirmed at 50 years old. Last year's term saw more than half its cases decided unanimously, something many court watchers cite as the outcome of Roberts' desire to foster agreement through narrower rulings. He also notably wrote the 5-4 opinion that shot down a major challenge to President Barack Obama's healthcare law. \"I think he cares deeply about how the 'Roberts court' looks,\" Lithwick says, and knows he can move the court slowly over decades. \"He doesn't want huge swings, except in areas he feels very strongly about,\" Coyle says, like government's role in racial issues, campaign finance's relation to free speech and the structure of constitution. Roberts also looks to keep decorum on the bench during oral arguments. On the court since: 8 August 2009 How she got to the court: Sotomayor was born to Puerto Rican parents in the Bronx. As a student at Princeton University, she fought for hiring more Latino professors and admitting more Latino students. After Yale Law school, she became a prosecutor in New York and was later named to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal appeals courts are often the final step before the Supreme Court for cases. In the second circuit, Sotomayor authored more than 150 majority opinions - including a few that were ultimately overruled by the higher court. Who is she as a justice? Sotomayor is the first Hispanic justice. She's also been one of the most public facing - her memoir appeared on the New York Times' best-selling list, she appeared twice on Sesame Street, once to adjudicate a dispute between Goldilocks and Baby Bear, and she helped drop the ball in Times Square on New Year's Eve 2013.  \"She's trying really hard to demystify the court, showing 'You can be a justice too',\" Lithwick says. Her former experience as a prosecutor and trial judge often leads her to challenge lawyers on the facts of a case, says Marcia Coyle, the chief Washington correspondent for the National Law Journal. \"She knows how criminal trials operate,\" Coyle says. On the court since: 10 April 2017 How he got to the court: At 49, Gorsuch was the youngest nominee in a quarter of a century when he was approved in 2017. The Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. He began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, and worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Who is he as a justice? Gorsuch succeeded the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and was welcomed by conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law. In his first year on the court he has cemented the 5-4 conservative advantage, and that's been seen in a series of rulings on contentious issues such as the Trump travel ban, trade union fees and gerrymandering. On the court since: 6 October 2018 How he got to the court: Kavanaugh served on the influential Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit and was formerly a White House aide under George W Bush. He previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. His confirmation process was one of the most controversial in recent years amid allegations of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, which he denied. After a hearing in which one of his accusers gave a dramatic testimony of the alleged incident and Kavanaugh fiercely defended his record, he was approved by the Senate by 50-48. Born in Washington, DC in 1965, Kavanaugh studied at Georgetown Preparatory School an all-boys school in Bethesda, Maryland, and graduated from Yale College and Yale Law School. Who is he as a justice? He succeeded Anthony Kennedy, who was the Supreme Court's swing vote, often casting the deciding opinion in 5-4 cases, consolidating a conservative majority at the top court. Some Democrats fiercely opposed to his name for his views on delicate issues such as abortion. His views on the environment and gun rights have also raised concerns among environmentalists and gun control activists. On the court since: 27 October 2020 How she got to the court: Born in New Orleans of Irish and French ancestry, Barrett was the eldest of seven children in a devoutly Catholic family and is now herself a mother of seven. She was the student body vice-president at her all-girls Catholic high school. After graduating first in her class at Notre Dame Law School, in Indiana, she clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, and later worked on George W Bush's election lawsuit in 2000. Barrett also became a distinguished law professor at her alma mater. She was picked for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 by President Donald Trump and was nominated to the high court less than three years later. Who is she as a justice? Often considered a protege of Justice Scalia, Barrett is a proponent of textualism, the view that judges should apply the law as written and interpret the US Constitution as it was originally intended. In her acceptance speech at the White House, Barrett said: \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\" She has said her Catholic faith does not influence her rulings. Past legal opinions and remarks on abortion and gay marriage have made her popular with the religious right, but have earned her vehement opposition from the left. She drew scrutiny for her reported leadership role, with the title of \"handmaid\", in the People of Praise, a tight-knit, Christian faith-based group.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

A woman staying at the Grand Beach Hotel in Miami spotted Instagram model Courtney Clenney with her father Friday at the hotel's lobby bar\u00a0after the April 3 stabbing death of her boyfriend, Christian Tobechukwu Obumseli. Obumseli, 27, suffered \"an apparent knife wound\" in a domestic violence incident before first responders rushed him 2 \u00bd miles away to the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami police said in a statement. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. In a video of the encounter at Grand Beach Hotel posted to social media, Clenney and her father can be seen getting up and leaving the hotel lobby while another guest demands that they leave. \"You should go. Yeah, you should go,\" the guest, who goes by the Instagram username nnenna_xoxo, tells Clenney and her father in the video. No charges have been filed in the case. Clenney's lawyer, Frank Preito, said she was defending herself. FLORIDA MAN DEAD, MODEL LOVER FOUND SOAKED IN BLOOD Preito told Fox News Digital Saturday that Clenney and her father were staying at the hotel on Miami Beach's Collins Avenue because they are cooperating in the Miami Police Department's investigation of the incident, and she did not want to stay at her Miami apartment where the fatal stabbing occurred last weekend. \"It is unfortunate that a member of the public, knowing absolutely nothing about the circumstances and events surrounding the death of Mr. Obumseli, would take the opportunity to harass the Clenney family during a time when they are trying to be supportive of Courtney,\" Prieto said. \"Courtney was seated at a table in the hotel lobby area where there is also a bar.

With that said, we would ask for the public\u2019s understanding about observing the Clenney family\u2019s privacy at this time.\" Lee Merritt, a prominent civil rights attorney representing Obumseli\u2019s family, has not responded to multiple requests for comment. Christian Tobechukwu Obumseli suffered \"an apparent knife wound\" in a domestic violence incident Sunday, according to Miami police.

The front of her white sweatpants is stained red, as are her arms, chest, stomach and forehead. Authorities said they had interviewed a woman who was involved in \"a physical altercation\" with Obumseli and that homicide detectives were investigating. A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital that Clenney was taken to a hospital for a mental health evaluation. Miami-based WPLG 10 reported Friday that friends of the couple described \"a very rocky relationship,\" although the sources gave conflicting stories about who might have been the aggressor.

The images posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are labelled with a triumphant caption, declaring that this was the result of \"hits from Javelins on [Russian] military equipment\". The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, can be controlled by a portable unit that doesn't look much different from a video game console - but can send a metre-long projectile straight through the side or top of an armoured tank. The very presence of the American-made weapons \"causes panic\" among Russian troops, the Ukrainian military claims - and the US has sent thousands of them. Javelin missiles are among the items that have been sent to Ukraine through a series of military assistance packages. In total, more than $3bn in military aid has been sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. The latest $800m (\u00a3612.5m) package, announced by President Joe Biden on Thursday, also includes heavy artillery, howitzers and tactical drones to be used on the flat plains in eastern Ukraine. Mr Biden also banned Russian-flagged ships from entering US ports. Other armaments sent so far include drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky. But will these shipments help Ukraine overcome Russia's more numerous - and better equipped - invasion force? The most recent US security aid package for Ukraine includes \"dozens\" of howitzers - a type of artillery that fires shells at targets on high trajectories - as well as 144,000 rounds of ammunition and tactical drones. \"We're in a critical window now of time where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,\" Mr Biden said on Wednesday, adding that the weapons are a reflection of \"Ukraine's needs\" as the war shifts towards the largely flat terrain of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Previous announcements of weapons for Ukraine have included a wide range of military equipment, ranging from body armour, helmets and rifles to radar systems, armoured vehicles and Soviet-designed helicopters that once belonged to Afghanistan. Besides Javelin missiles, the most powerful weapons include Stinger anti-aircraft systems, once famously used to shoot down Soviet planes in Afghanistan. The US has also shipped hundreds of \"Switchblade\" drones, which are designed to be sent crashing into enemy targets before exploding. While US defence officials have been reluctant to provide Ukraine with weapons that its forces weren't already familiar with, this week Pentagon spokesman John Kirby confirmed that a \"small number\" of Ukrainian troops will be trained on how to use the Switchblades, as well as US-supplied artillery systems. \"We're doing the best we can to focus on the kinds of capabilities we know they need and that they want and are using, and...secondary to that, to try to get them systems that they don't need a lot of start-up time for, that they can put in the field almost immediately,\" Mr Kirby said. Additionally, the Pentagon said on Thursday that it is giving Ukraine \"ghost drones\" - similar in capabilities to the Switchblade - that Mr Kirby said were \"rapidly developed by the Air Force in response specifically to Ukrainian requirements\". The range and specific capabilities of the \"ghost drones\", however, are not publicly known. Military experts say that the US-supplied anti-tank weapons have been among the most effective weapons in Ukraine's arsenal since the war began. \"Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we're sending a lot of those in as well,\" Mr Biden said this week of US aid to Ukraine. The invading Russian forces \"are primarily mechanised forces\" - meaning armoured convoys - so \"the best thing you can do is take them [the vehicles] out\", said former US Army Colonel Christopher Mayer. Ukraine has received a variety of anti-tank systems from several countries, which helps increase the \"lethality\" of Ukraine's forces against Russian vehicles, Mr Mayer said. \"If you give them a variety of anti-tank systems, it provides them with multiple opportunities to punch through whatever particular defensive armour protection systems that tank has,\" he said. And while their claims can't be independently verified, Ukrainian officials say they are putting the weapons to good use. As of this week, Ukraine claims to have destroyed more than 800 tanks and 2,000 other Russian vehicles. Anti-tank weapons, however, do nothing to help Ukraine combat Russia's air force, which for eight weeks  has been striking targets across the country. That requires anti-aircraft weapons, about 25,000 of which had been given to Ukraine by the US and its allies by 7 April. Of these, the most well-known is the man-portable, shoulder-fired Stinger system. The system has been seen in conflicts around the world since 1981. It was most famously used in Afghanistan, where US-supplied Stingers helped bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation. It is effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft at up to about 3,800m (12,400ft), making it relatively useless against higher-flying Russian bombers. Maintaining an ability to strike these aircraft has been a high priority for Ukrainian military planners, particularly since some of its own air defence systems have been destroyed during the war. In mid-April, however, nearby Slovakia sent Ukraine the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile, which is designed to strike aircraft at higher altitudes. The shipment was part of a deal with the US, which agreed to deploy US units fielding an American-made anti-aircraft system - Patriot missiles - to Slovakia. The US has so far been reluctant to send Ukraine US-made tanks, arguing that Ukrainian troops aren't familiar with the vehicles. \"The kinds of tanks they know how to use are not the tanks that we have in our armoury,\" Mr Kirby said at the Pentagon on 19 April. \"But other nations have provided some tanks [and] some nations have provided spare parts so that they can get their inoperable tanks operable again.\" Similarly, while the US has so far committed to sending Ukraine 16 Mi-17 helicopters, it has not directly sent aircraft to Ukraine and has described a plan to send Soviet-made Mig-29 jets from other countries - such as Poland - to Ukraine as untenable. US allies, however. have provided spare parts that have allowed its air force to continue to fly limited sorties against a numerically-superior Russian air force. On 20 April, a senior US defence official said that Ukraine has 20 more aircraft available to them now than three weeks ago as a result of allied-supplied spare parts.

Maxwell was convicted in December of sex trafficking and other charges for recruiting young women to be sexually abused by late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex crimes charges. After Maxwell was found guilty, the juror told reporters in interviews that he had shared his experience with the panel during deliberations. He described having swayed some jurors who were on the fence that an imperfect recollection of the abuse did not mean it didn't happen.

The five-figure penalties on the two flyers accused of violence are part of $2m (\u00a31.5m) in fines levied this year. US airlines have seen record numbers of disruptive passengers since early 2021, with many incidents involving the refusal to wear an anti-viral facemask. The fines were announced by transport secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday. \"If you are on an airplane, don't be a jerk and don't endanger the flight crews and fellow passengers,\" he said in an appearance on ABC's The View. \"If you do, you will be fined by the FAA.\" In one incident, an American Airlines passenger travelling from Texas to North Carolina has been asked to pay a $81,950 fine for threatening to hurt a flight attendant. The attendant had offered to help the passenger after she fell into the aisle of the plane. The unnamed passenger then allegedly pushed an airline worker and tried to open the cabin door. While flight attendants attempted to restrain her, she repeatedly hit one staff member in the head. When she was placed in cuffs, \"she spit at, headbutted, bit and tried to kick the crew and other passengers\", the FAA said in a news release. In the other incident, the passenger was flying on Delta Air Lines from Las Vegas to Atlanta. She allegedly tried to \"hug and kiss the passenger seated next to her, walked to the front of the aircraft to try to exit during flight; refused to return to her seat; and bit another passenger multiple times\". That passenger, who is also unnamed, was physically restrained by crew members and has now been asked to pay a fine of $77,272. Neither incident involved a failure to adhere to Covid measures. In his interview with The View, Mr Buttigieg said the US would decide by 18 April on whether to extend the federal requirement to wear masks on planes and in airports. The FAA announced a \"zero-tolerance\" policy on unruly passengers in January 2021, and has issued some $7m in fines since then. They have recorded 7,060 air rage incidents and say around 70% involved masking rules. But the rate of incidents has now declined by 60% since its high last year.

The Department recommends that children with underlying conditions are the best candidates for the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 it says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faParents are encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits with their children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health care practitioner when evaluating whether their child should receive a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for children with underlying health conditions or comorbidities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Florida is the first state to break from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations that everyone age 5 and older receive the vaccine. Why Florida is now recommending healthy kids *not* get vaccinated against Covid-19 Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Lapado announced the measure on Monday during a roundtable discussion hosted by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Explaining the decision, DeSantis said Ladapo was concerned that the vaccine was \u201a\u00c4\u00fabeing pushed on people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are not just going to follow the CDC in the state of Florida,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to do our own stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The guidance released Tuesday says that the risks of the vaccine outweigh its benefits in children who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have underlying health conditions. It cites reports of increased incidence of myocarditis \u201a\u00c4\u00ec inflammation of the heart muscle \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in 16- and 17-year-olds who got the Covid-19 vaccine. The study that the guidance uses to support this concern also found that the risk of myocarditis is rare, identifying 105.9 cases per 1 million doses of the mRNA vaccine given in 16- to 17-year-olds. Florida surgeon general favorably recommended after Democrats walk out of confirmation hearing The guidance also cites data from a clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found no cases of severe Covid-19 in a group of children ages 5 to 11, whether they received the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. However, that study found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing Covid-19 infection. The department also based the guidance off a New York-based study that found vaccine effectiveness for children ages 5 to 17 dropped significantly during the Omicron surge. But that research concluded that the vaccine continued to be effective against severe disease in children. That study is a preprint and has not been published in a peer-reviewed professional journal, so a note in bold at the top of the study advises that it should not be used to guide clinical practice. Health experts have been very critical of the department\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recommendations. CDC director rebukes DeSantis for scolding high school students over masks: 'It is absolutely their choice' In a statement Tuesday, Dr. Daniel P. McQuillen, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said his group \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrongly opposes the state of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to put politics over the health and safety of children. The Florida Surgeon General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to recommend against COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children flies in the face of the best medical guidance and only serves to further sow distrust in vaccines that have proven to be the safest, most effective defense against severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The head of the University of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health system sent an email Tuesday to staff that distanced the medical network from Ladapo in light of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement.

Centrist Macron and Le Pen, a long-time standard-bearer for the French far-right, were the top two candidates in the first round of Sunday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote, picking up 27.8% and 23.2% of the ballots respectively, according to the French Interior Ministry. Twelve candidates ran for the top job. Since none of them received more than 50% of the ballots in the first round, the top two candidates will face each other in a runoff on April 24. The first round of the 2022 contest was marked by voter apathy, with participation estimated at 73.3%, according to an analysis by pollster Ifop-Fiducial for French broadcasters TF1 and LCI \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the lowest in a first round in 20 years. While Macron received more votes than any of the other candidates in the first round, he is a polarizing figure whose approval rating has sagged during his first term. In a speech after polls closed on Sunday, he urged citizens to vote in the second round. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNothing is settled and the debate that we will have in the coming 15 days is decisive for our country and our Europe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want a France which, having left Europe, would have as its only allies the international populists and xenophobes. That is not us. I want a France faithful to humanism, to the spirit of enlightenment,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Macron is seeking to become the first French president to win reelection since Jacques Chirac in 2002. Polls have given him a consistent edge over the rest of the field, but the race has tightened significantly in the past month. Polling by Ifop-Fiducial released on Sunday showed that Macron would win a second-round contest against Le Pen by just 51% to 49%. Le Pen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s support has steadily risen in recent weeks. Though she is best known for her far-right policies such as drastically restricting immigration and banning Muslim headscarves in public places, she has run a more mainstream campaign this time around, softening her language and focusing more on pocketbook issues like the rising cost of living, a top concern for the French electorate. In her speech Sunday, Le Pen vowed to be a president for \u201a\u00c4\u00faall the French\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if she wins the second round, and called on those who didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t vote for Macron to support her in the second round. Leftist firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon came third, with 22% of the vote. He enjoyed a late surge in support and was considered a possible dark horse candidate to challenge Macron. Who Melenchon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voters choose to back in the second round could decide the presidency, experts say. Melenchon told his supporters that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe must not give a single vote to Mrs. Le Pen,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but did not explicitly back Macron. No other candidate received more than 10% of the votes. Far-right political commentator turned presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, who enjoyed a seat among the top three candidates until March, according to Ifop polling, came in fourth at 7.1%. The other candidates on Sunday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ballot have quickly begun throwing their weight behind the top two. While Zemmour called on his backers to vote for Le Pen, the others urged their supporters to steer clear of her. The candidates from the traditional center-left and center-right parties, the Socialists and the Republicans, have already backed Macron. Socialist Anne Hidalgo said a Le Pen victory would instill in France \u201a\u00c4\u00faa hatred of everyone set against everyone,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while Republican Valerie Pecresse said she was sincerely worried for the country because \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe far right has never been so close to winning.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe project of Marine Le Pen will open France to discord, impotence, and collapse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Pecresse. Macron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s political rise shattered the playing field, as his centrist political party has pulled supporters away from the traditional centrist parties, the Socialists and the Republicans. Both its candidates polled under 5% on Sunday. Surveys ahead of the race showed that a second round of Macron vs. Le Pen was the most likely outcome. Macron handily beat Le Pen five years ago, but experts have said that a second contest between the two would be much tighter than the 2017 race. Macron is no longer a political upstart and must run on a mixed record. While his ambitious plan to bolster the European Union\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s autonomy and geopolitical heft won him respect abroad and at home, he remains a divisive figure when it comes to domestic policies. His handling of the yellow vest movement, one of France\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most prolonged protests in decades, was widely panned, and his record on the Covid-19 pandemic is inconclusive. Macron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signature policy during the crisis \u201a\u00c4\u00ec requiring people to show proof of vaccination to go about their lives as normal \u201a\u00c4\u00ec helped increase vaccination rates but fired up a vocal minority against his presidency. Macron has, so far, done very little campaigning. Experts believe his strategy was to avoid the political mudslinging as long as possible to brandish his image as the most presidential of all the candidates. Polling showed him consistently leading all candidates, and he was considered a shoo-in to make the second round. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe widespread dissatisfaction with Macron (especially among the young) means that the outcome is uncertain and unpredictable. Le Pen will continue to exploit this, and a major political upset therefore remains possible,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said CNN European affairs commentator Dominic Thomas of the second round matchup. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHowever much they may dislike Le Pen, there is a world of difference between her and Macron, and how she would disrupt European and global politics.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Le Pen is the daughter of another famous far-right presidential candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen. The elder Le Pen made it to the runoff against Jacques Chirac in 2002, but Marine Le Pen has managed to perform better than her father in the first round of each of the past two presidential elections. Le Pen has tried to portray herself as a very different candidate to the one who lost to Macron in 2017, when she attempted to position herself to the forgotten French working classes as her country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s answer to then-US President Donald Trump. While her economic nationalist stance, views on immigration, euroskepticism and positions on Islam in France are unchanged, Le Pen has sought to broaden her appeal. The contest was at first predicted to be a referendum on the dominance of the extreme right in French politics, but the war in Ukraine \u201a\u00c4\u00ec another key issue for voters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec upended the race. According to Ifop polling, Macron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s support peaked in early March, as potential voters rallied around the flag and rewarded the president for his attempts to mediate the conflict in Ukraine before Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion, even if it was a failure. Many experts also expected the war to hurt the Le Pen, who had been a vocal admirer of Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader who has become a pariah in the West due to the Kremlin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to invade Ukraine in late February. Le Pen visited the Russian president during her 2017 campaign; this time around, she was forced to scrap a leaflet with a photo of her and Putin from that trip after Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unprovoked attack on its neighbor. Thomas, the CNN European affairs commentator, explained that the forthcoming debates will be crucial if Macron is to convince voters that Le Pen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s previous support for Putin should disqualify her. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe will be vulnerable on a range of domestic issues, but she will have difficulty convincing the electorate of her foreign policy credentials, especially given her longstanding links with Russia,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.

A San Francisco jury on Monday found a police officer facing four counts of assault and battery charges not guilty after four days of deliberation. District Attorney (DA) Chesa Boudin, who first announced charges against San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Officer Terrance Stangel in December 2020, was accused of withholding evidence in the case earlier this year. Stangel was accused of unnecessarily beating a Black man named Dacari Spiers with a baton in October 2019, breaking Spiers' wrist and leg, while responding to a domestic violence call. \"We are thankful that the jury was able to see through the dishonesty of the DA\u2019s office in this case and see it for what it was \u2013 unjust and unsupported,\" Stangel's attorney, Nicole Pifari, said in a statement Monday evening following the verdict in a San Francisco Superior Court. \"Everyone should be deeply concerned about this case, about this District Attorney, and about the rule of law in San Francisco.\" Police officer Terrance Stangel, second from the left, enters Department 27 at the Hall of Justice with his attorney Nicole Pifari on Monday, March 7, 2022, in San Francisco, California.

Hayashi told Caffese\u00a0that she never disclosed information from a female witness who claimed to see Spiers beating a woman before Stangel hit him with a baton and that she feared she would be fired if she did, according to the outlet. SAN FRANCISCO DA BOUDIN'S OFFICE \u2018THREATENED\u2019 INVESTIGATOR MULTIPLE TIMES TO WITHHOLD EVIDENCE: TRANSCRIPT Pifari filed a motion to dismiss the case on Jan. 24, citing \"prosecutorial misconduct\" and \"deceptive\" methods by the DA's office.

Spiers and his girlfriend begged the officers to stop, and he was left with \"horrendous blows with his hands and wrists, which caused severe injuries, including a severely broken wrist,\" the complaint states. Spiers accused the city of violating his civil rights. On March 2, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted Spiers' motion to sanction the city and county of San Francisco for withholding evidence from Spiers. Video footage of the incident released last year shows a chaotic scene in which Spiers questions officers' use of force, saying he didn't do anything. Stangel was acquitted of felony charges, including battery with serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon and assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury. He faced up to seven years in prison, according to the Chronicle. Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, Brandon Caserta, 33, and Barry Croft, 46, each faced a kidnapping conspiracy charge. Mr Harris and Mr Caserta were found not guilty, but the charges against Mr Fox and Mr Croft ended in mistrial. The government had argued they targeted Gretchen Whitmer, 50, in a 2020 plot. Jurors began deliberating this week after 14 days of testimony and had indicated earlier on Friday that they were deadlocked on some of the charges. They ultimately reached no verdict against Mr Fox,  who was alleged to be the group's ringleader, and Mr Croft, both of whom were also facing an additional count each of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. In a statement sent by her office on Friday, Governor Whitmer thanked prosecutors and law enforcement for their work on the case and warned that \"Michiganders and Americans - especially our children - are living through the normalisation of political violence\". According to secret chats and private conversations revealed in court, members of the group - some of whom were said to be militia members - viewed Ms Whitmer as a \"tyrant\". Prosecutors said the men planned to abduct her from her holiday home, conduct some kind of \"treason trial\" and set her adrift in a boat on Lake Michigan. But lawyers for the accused countered that the scheme was mostly \"smoke and mirrors\", profane talk by angry and disillusioned men. Throughout the trial, they maintained that the men had been entrapped - or improperly induced into the crime - by an undercover FBI operation. The FBI has said it began tracking the group's movements after spotting online discussions of political violence. According to an FBI affidavit, an undercover source attended a June 2020 meeting in Ohio, where a group of Michigan-based militia members discussed overthrowing state governments \"that they believed were violating the US Constitution\". That October, the bureau announced the arrests of 13 alleged plotters. On the witness stand, two of the men - Ty Garbin, 26, and Kaleb Franks, 27 - said the participants acted of their own volition and were free to leave the group whenever they wanted. Both men had taken plea deals to avoid a prison sentence. FBI agent Timothy \"Red\" Bates also took the stand, testifying that the group discussed blowing up bridges near the governor's house to thwart law enforcement. But the defence alleged an FBI informant named Daniel \"Big Dan\" Chappel who infiltrated the group acted as a \"double agent\", befriending and radicalising the men to advance the plot. Mr Harris - the only defendant of the four to take the stand - slammed Big Dan as \"a liar\" who \"got scared by memes\" shared within the group. Mr Fox's lawyer also attacked Big Dan for \"[beating] the drum and [getting] them all worked up\".\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The eldest Biden grandchild, 28, and her fianc\u00e9, Peter Neal, 24, will celebrate at perhaps the most exclusive venue in the US. Ms Biden said she was \"endlessly grateful\" to her \"Nana and Pop\" for the honour. Four other wedding receptions have ever been held at the presidential home. Ms Biden, a graduate of Columbia Law School and the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, announced her engagement to Mr Neal, a law student at the University of Pennsylvania, in September. Ms Biden will only be the fifth bride to have a White House wedding reception, to be held in November. The previous one took place in 2008, when Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former president George W Bush, celebrated a month after she was wed in Texas. It has actually been more common to hold wedding ceremonies themselves at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - there have been 18 in total. Since the first White House wedding in 1812 - between the sister of First Lady Dolley Madison and Thomas Todd - most have involved close family members of the first couple.

Other recent White House weddings have included those of Lynda Bird Johnson - daughter of President Lyndon Johnson - who married Charles Spittal Robb in a grand event in the East Room in 1967. In 1971, Tricia Nixon - daughter of President Richard Nixon and Pat Nixon, was the first to hold a wedding in the White House Rose Garden. The latest White House wedding, in 2013, was one of just three not involving family of the president.

Hayashi told Caffese\u00a0that she never disclosed information from a female witness who claimed to see Spiers beating a woman before Stangel hit him with a baton and that she feared she would be fired if she did, according to the outlet. SAN FRANCISCO DA BOUDIN'S OFFICE \u2018THREATENED\u2019 INVESTIGATOR MULTIPLE TIMES TO WITHHOLD EVIDENCE: TRANSCRIPT Pifari filed a motion to dismiss the case on Jan. 24, citing \"prosecutorial misconduct\" and \"deceptive\" methods by the DA's office. The memo in support of the motion to dismiss filed by Pifari includes a transcript from the witness to 911, which is what initially led police to respond to the 2019 incident. Police officer Terrance Stangel, center, and lawyer Nicole Pifari enter the courtroom at the Hall of Justice on Feb. 8, 2022, in San Francisco, California. (Gabrielle Lurie/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) The call transcript reads as follows: \"I would like to report \u2026 I think it's called domestic violence or something because, um, there's this guy who is beating up on this girl. \u2026 He's like, um, holding her like by the neck, like draggin' her by the neck. \u2026 She was trying to get away, then he grabbed, and then he got her again.\" A second witness described similar details in a statement, including in Pifari's motion. Boudin prematurely labeled one of the witnesses as a \"racially-biased Karen,\" according to FOX 2 San Francisco. \"The citizens of San Francisco should be asking themselves why Chesa Boudin would come out of the starting gate [labeling] the two African American women who called 911 as \u2018Karen Callers,\u2019\" Pifari said in her statement. \"\u2026 If Chesa Boudin is willing to break and bend the law as many times as his office did in this case, everyone should be afraid.\" Spiers filed a federal lawsuit against the city of San Francisco in February 2020, which states that he was \"consoling his girlfriend about the theft\" of her wallet before the attack, \"and the two were leaning against the car and were engaged in hugging and kissing each other.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The lawsuit then alleges that two or more officers approached Spiers at that moment and abruptly grabbed him. Spiers and his girlfriend begged the officers to stop, and he was left with \"horrendous blows with his hands and wrists, which caused severe injuries, including a severely broken wrist,\" the complaint states. Spiers accused the city of violating his civil rights. On March 2, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted Spiers' motion to sanction the city and county of San Francisco for withholding evidence from Spiers. Video footage of the incident released last year shows a chaotic scene in which Spiers questions officers' use of force, saying he didn't do anything. Stangel was acquitted of felony charges, including battery with serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon and assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury. He faced up to seven years in prison, according to the Chronicle. Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

Eric Greitens alleged he was physically abusive toward his children and her, according to court documents filed Monday. Greitens resigned as governor in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct and has been trying to mount a political comeback in his pursuit of a US Senate seat. A number of his GOP primary rivals called on Monday for him to drop out of the race following the abuse allegations made by his ex-wife. Sheena Greitens, who now resides in Texas with the former couple\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s two children, said she grew so afraid of her former husband that she sought to limit his access to weapons and began sleeping in her children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s room out of concern for their safety, according to an affidavit filed in the Circuit Court of Boone County in Missouri, as part of her effort to have a custody case moved to Texas. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn early June 2018, I became afraid for my safety and that of our children at our home, which was fairly isolated, due to Eric\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unstable and coercive behavior,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, according to court records from the ongoing custody battle. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis behavior included physical violence toward our children, such as cuffing our then three-year-old son across the face at the dinner table in front of me and yanking him around by his hair.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sheena Greitens said she and others were so concerned about Eric Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 behavior that they limited his access to firearms on three occasions. She said she was concerned about the \u201a\u00c4\u00faescalation of physical violence\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and eventually, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI started sleeping in my children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s room simply to try to keep them safe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to her affidavit. In a statement, Eric Greitens denied the allegations. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBeing a father is the joy of my life and my single most important responsibility,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI will continue to love and care for my beautiful sons with all of my being, and that includes fighting for the truth and against completely fabricated, baseless allegations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, his attorney asked the judge to seal the custody case. In her affidavit, Sheena Greitens laid out a series of allegations of verbal threats and physical abuse against both her and their children. She detailed how Eric Greitens allegedly threatened to use his political ties to tarnish his ex-wife\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reputation. In one instance, she claimed Eric Greitens had \u201a\u00c4\u00faknocked me down and confiscated my cell phone, wallet, and keys so that I was unable to call for help or extricate myself and our children,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the court filing. In another 2019 incident, one of the children returned from a visit with Eric Greitens with a swollen face, bleeding gums and a loose tooth, according to her court filing. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said Dad had hit him; however, Eric said they were roughhousing and it had been an accident,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sheena Greitens said in her affidavit. At one point, Sheena Greitens said she tried to flee with the children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen I told Eric about my plans, he threatened to come to the airport and have me arrested for kidnapping and child abuse, saying that because of his authority as a former Governor who had supported law enforcement, the police would support him and not believe me, and I would lose our children,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the affidavit. Sheena and Eric Greitens divorced in 2020. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 campaign manager Dylan Johnson said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHis ex-wife is engaged in a last-ditch attempt to vindictively destroy her ex-husband. Though she knows that the press will viciously repeat her false allegations, Eric has always been a great Dad, who loves his boys and has always put them first, and that is why he is filing for full custody of his children.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In a Tuesday statement, Sheena Greitens stood by her sworn affidavit and said she would provide evidence and documentation if the court requests it. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMy only interest is what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best for my two children, and for the last four years, I have gone to great lengths to keep these family matters private to protect them,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in her statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI am not interested in litigating this matter anywhere other than the courtroom.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Eric Greitens has been vying for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Roy Blunt. The crowded primary also includes US Rep. Vicky Hartzler, State Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long and others. In the wake of the latest allegations, Hartzler, Schmitt and Long called on Greitens to drop out of the race. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have one thing that I want to say: real men never abuse women and children. Period. End of story,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hartzler said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time for Eric to get out of the Senate race and to get professional help.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Schmitt called the abuse allegations \u201a\u00c4\u00fasickening,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe behavior described in this affidavit is cause for Eric Greitens to be in prison, not on the ballot for U.S. Senate. He should end his campaign immediately.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Long said he was \u201a\u00c4\u00fashocked and appalled\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by what was in the affidavit, adding of Greitens: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe is clearly unfit to represent the state of Missouri in the United States Senate. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no way he can stay in this race.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, on Monday became the highest-ranking Republican to say Greitens should leave the race. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who called on Greitens to resign as governor in 2018 and has endorsed Hartzler in the Senate primary, also called for him to drop out, expressing concern that Republicans could lose the seat if Greitens were the nominee. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had no comment on Greitens on Monday. Walking in silence without saying anything, the Kentucky Republican would not respond to questions about whether the Senate candidate should drop out. On Tuesday, Blunt \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the senator Greitens is vying to replace \u201a\u00c4\u00ec also said Greitens should step aside if the allegations against him are true. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the statements filed with the court are true, he should not be a candidate for the Senate,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blunt told CNN. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 stunning fall from grace in 2018 came as he faced calls for impeachment from the GOP-controlled state legislature and a criminal charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec invasion of privacy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec related to a 2015 affair, in which his former hairdresser alleged he tied her up, coerced her into oral sex and threatened to blackmail her with partially nude photos to cover up their affair. Greitens admitted to the affair but refuted the blackmail claim. He was separately charged with another felony \u201a\u00c4\u00ec tampering with computer data \u201a\u00c4\u00ec for allegedly misusing a veterans charity\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s donor list for his 2016 gubernatorial campaign. The criminal charges against Greitens were dropped. And a former FBI agent investigating the blackmail allegations was later indicted for perjury and tampering with physical evidence. When a Missouri ethics panel investigated Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 campaign misconduct, it found no evidence of wrongdoing but fined the campaign for failing to report in-kind contributions. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 accuser never recanted her sexual misconduct allegations. Sheena Greitens said in her affidavit filed Monday that Eric Greitens admitted to her that he took the photo that resulted in the invasion of privacy charge, but \u201a\u00c4\u00fahe threatened that I would be exposed to legal jeopardy if I ever disclosed that fact to anyone.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She also alleged that in the spring and summer of 2018, \u201a\u00c4\u00faEric repeatedly threatened to kill himself unless I provided specific public support to him.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Earlier this year, the former governor told CNN that he did \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 nothing wrong with his former hairdresser and claimed that he resigned for his two children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt was the thing that I had to do for the people who I love the most, particularly for my boys, given those tremendous lies and the tremendous pressure that was on my kids,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. But Sheena Greitens pushed back on that explanation in her court filing, saying their young children were \u201a\u00c4\u00faunaware of the scandal, and I would like them to remain so until they are older.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have privately entreated Eric to stop introducing false and misleading information about our marriage and divorce into the public in his quest for political office,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to her court filing. Before the scandals, Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, was a rising star in the Republican Party. In the Senate race, he has completely aligned himself with former President Donald Trump. He has spread the lie that Trump won the 2020 presidential election, said he would not support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for Senate GOP leader and recently visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Florida resort, where he met with Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who advises his Senate campaign.

Speaking at a White House event on Friday in celebration of her confirmation, Judge Jackson said: \"I am feeling up to the task, primarily because I know that I am not alone. I am standing on the shoulders of my own role models, generations of Americans who never had anything close to this kind of opportunity, but who got up every day and went to work believing in the promise of America.\" She was joined by US President Joe Biden, who nominated her to the court, and Vice-President Kamala Harris, who also made history when she became the first black woman and first Asian woman to become vice-president. The BBC spoke with black women who are studying the law about what Justice Jackson's appointment means to them. \"[It] blows the whole game wide open for myself and other black women in the legal world. Black women only make up 2% of the profession. Now that we've seen a black woman make it to the highest position in the legal profession, it seems like anything is possible. I'm going to walk with a different sense of confidence, knowing that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to. \"I am just so grateful for Judge Jackson.

For this timing to happen in my last semester of law school, it really just hits home in a different way.\" \"Even with our accolades and education, we are oftentimes barred from the very positions we have prepared for, hoped for and prayed for. So having this esteemed force in the field of law join the bench and highest court of these United States would mean the world for every little black girl to know that they too can aspire for the best and be a vessel of wisdom and justice in this country and beyond. \"Even though the constitution was not written with us in mind or penned with us at the table, we are still more than capable of interpreting it in a way that ensures equality for all of us - something that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has an audacious record and reputation of doing.\" \"While watching the confirmation hearing of KBJ, I can imagine that I will be in true astonishment. I'm feeling an array of emotions including joy, pride, and what feels like a breath of fresh air. And although I know I'll feel this way, I know that in the back of my mind, I can't help but to think of all of the backlash she has received and will receive in the future. But all of that doesn't matter, she's made it.\" \"It's important to note that black people are not a monolith. We have different backgrounds and philosophies just like everyone else. With that said, representation matters. \"It's not just about black law students, it's about black people everywhere who don't see themselves reflected in the spaces they aspire to be.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAfter 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians \u201a\u00c4\u00fahostage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration. Ukrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing \u201a\u00c4\u00fachildren, women and the elderly\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 out of the city, and have launched an attack \u201a\u00c4\u00faprecisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Joint Forces Operation said. CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response. A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been \u201a\u00c4\u00faisolated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it \u201a\u00c4\u00fain any significant way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days. Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe main issue today remains humanitarian aid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video. Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are \u201a\u00c4\u00faforced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, adding that Moscow is preventing \u201a\u00c4\u00fahumanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces \u201a\u00c4\u00faviolated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance in northern Ukraine. That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing \u201a\u00c4\u00faseveral civilians\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fasidelines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe will fight to the end,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s famous wartime speech. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrengthen the sanctions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a terrorist state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. Zelensky's heroism is coming up against Western red lines \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stoltenberg. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe situation could spiral out of control,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe other half largely from inside Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA little bit more than 70\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles have been fired from Belarus, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faonly a half dozen or so\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

Maybe it was because the 9.2% he now owns is described as a passive stake, although those who know Musk do not expect it to stay that way for long. His first move was to launch a poll - asking whether people want an edit button, something long called for and perhaps something he personally needs. The new announcement that he will join Twitter's board comes as no surprise. In a tweet on Tuesday, Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal said \"through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board\".

Musk's 9.2%  stake in the social media company may sound small, but Dan Ives, from analyst firm Wedbush, describes it as \"eye-popping\" - equating to 73.5 million shares in the social network. Shares in the platform soared following Monday's revelation that the Tesla founder had become the largest shareholder in the company - meaning that stake has already grown in value and is now worth more than $3bn. Musk's shareholding is four times greater than that of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive in November. Mr Ives believes the South African entrepreneur now has his eyes \"laser set\" on Twitter, and his significant holding will see him push for an active role in the management of the company. \"We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,\" he said. Musk has something of a love-hate relationship with Twitter. He is a frequent tweeter, with more than 80 million followers - and no stranger to controversy in his interactions on the social media site. The platform seems to suit his impulsive personality - last year he famously asked if he should sell 10% of his stock in his electric car firm Tesla, to which Twitter users said 'yes'. It led to Musk selling around $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of shares in the firm in November. Months earlier he had offered to sign a cheque for $6bn if the World Food Programme (WFP) could explain how it would be used to solve hunger around the globe - after an assertion made by the head of the UN programme. But tweeting has also got him into trouble. A 2018 post about Tesla stock led to an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission which ended with an agreement requiring the firm's lawyers to pre-approve certain tweets. It is unclear if that actually happens. Interestingly, the Wall Street Journal reports that his Twitter share filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which under normal circumstances would include a line saying he doesn't intend to influence the company, came with a 'Not Applicable' mark. The timing of the deal has also raised questions and could once again put Musk at loggerheads with financial regulators. His investment in Twitter was filed on 14 March, but not announced until this week. US securities law requires disclosure within 10 days of acquiring 5% of a company. Musk uses Twitter not just as a barometer for how he runs his own companies, but also increasingly to take the temperature of the nation. Last month, after he had lodged his investment with the SEC - but before his shareholding became public knowledge - he asked users whether they believed that free speech was essential to a functioning democracy and whether Twitter adheres to this principle. Cornell University's assistant professor Alexandra Cirone thinks this is evidence he may use his new stake \"to try to influence Twitter practices\" and for a \"more active play in the social media eco-system\". But others see more immediate issues with his musings. Howard Fischer, partner at law firm Moses & Singer, told Reuters that, given he had already bought a stake in Twitter, these questions could be seen as a form of market manipulation. \"I do suspect the SEC is going to look long and hard into whether they can bring manipulation charges, along with the failure to file,\" he said. Mr Agrawal is clearly watching his every move. In response to his edit button poll, which currently has 2.6 million responses, he urged voters to do so \"carefully\". Allow Twitter content?

Jack Dorsey had always rejected the idea, and critics point out that it could allow people to fundamentally change the meaning of tweets after they have been shared. It would be a big change for Twitter to include an edit button, and Musk is clearly keen to be part of that conversation. For a while last month, it looked as if Musk was intent on building a new social media platform as a rival to Twitter - and there he does have precedent from another prolific and controversial tweeter. Donald Trump, who was banned from Twitter in January 2021 after the Capitol riots, announced last autumn that he was launching his own social network - dubbed Truth Social - to \"stand up to the tyranny of big tech\". But six weeks after its launch, there is a waiting list of 1.5 million who are unable to use it - with the platform branded a disaster by Joshua Tucker, director of NYU's Center for social media and politics. According to Reuters, two key executives quit after the troubled launch. For those with shares in Musk's many other businesses - Space X, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company - there will doubtless be a sigh of relief that he didn't go down the same route as Mr Trump. But there will also be concerns that he has yet another passion project to distract him from the serious business of running his established firms. Not to mention the issues that might now be raised about the Twitter deal by the SEC. Social media expert Casey Newton points out that it is not the first time a big tech firm has eyed Twitter. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once bought a four percent share of the company \"and essentially did nothing with it,\" he writes. But he goes on to say that Ballmer never tweeted like Musk did: \"gleefully, annoyingly, constantly\". And it seems most likely that it will be from this Twitter account that Musk will let the world know what he intends to do next.

(Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images) Paul Whelan, now 52, worked in corporate security for about 10 years before his normal life disintegrated at the hands of the Russian government. His job involved him traveling to corporate locations to test the physical security of facilities his company worked with. He had traveled to Russia a half-dozen times from 2008 and 2018, but his connection to the country \"was really just as a tourist,\" his twin brother, Paul, told Fox News Digital. \"He wasn't there visiting any locations. He didn't work there. He just had made contacts with people who were in Russia,\" Whelan said. \"He happened to be in Russia, he happened to be in contact with those people, and his life fell apart.\" Paul Whelan, a former US marine accused of espionage and arrested in Russia in December 2018, stands inside a defendants' cage as he waits to hear his verdict in Moscow on June 15, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images) Paul, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran from Michigan, was in Russia to attend a wedding in December 2018 when he was arrested in Moscow. He was accused of espionage and convicted in June 2020, when a Russian court sentenced him to 16 years in prison. \"In hindsight, probably every American going to Russia in the last two or three years should have been worried about their personal security,\" Whelan said. JACK BARSKY: WHAT A RUSSIAN SPY'S JOB MIGHT LOOK LIKE NOW, FROM ONE OF THE KGB'S 'BEST-TRAINED' DOUBLE AGENTS Paul became known for his \"feisty\" personality and for his unwillingness to crumble to the Russian pressures and has maintained his innocence. In one iconic image from his trial, Whelan, now TKTK, held a white sign that read, among other phrases, \"Sham Trial!,\" \"No Human Rights! Paul\u2019s Life Matters!\" \"Decisive Action from POTUS and PMs Needed!\" and \"Happy Birthday Flora,\" his beloved dog. David Whelan said he last spoke to his brother in October 2018, but he and his siblings have remained steadfast in their efforts to bring Paul home safely. \"From the day that he was arrested on Dec. 28, 2018, for about 18 months until he was sent off to Mordovia to the labor colony, none of us were able to speak to him,\" Whelan said. Since around September 2020, Paul has been able to make near-daily calls to his parents and is also allowed to call the U.S. embassy. But there have been times that the family has suddenly lost contact with him, such as in June of this year, when he was \"sent to a hospital without requesting it.\" \"We have our own suspicions about why,\" David said, describing how it was \"just before a meeting between President Biden and President Putin. \"And then as soon as he came back from the hospital, he was put in solitary for a month,\" David went on. For that almost two-month period, he was unable to make phone calls to our parents.\" David said his brother has tried to be vocal even behind bars about conditions behind bars, \"and we\u2019ve tried to help him amplify his voice and presence.\" Whelan said his family has weekly meetings with the U.S. Embassy in Russia, and have continued to do so despite the complications that have arisen from the Russia-Ukraine War. He lauded the work and support of U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan and said the embassy forewarned the Whelan family early on about their concerns regarding Russia\u2019s impending invasion of Ukraine. \"The real issue for us was, if sanctions go into place, what does that do to impact the ability for us to flow money Paul \u2013 money that we get put on his phone card, money that we put in his prison account, so he can buy fresh fruits and vegetables,\" Whelan explained. \"As soon as we saw that these things were potentially coming, even though we didn't know the day that they would happen, we transferred as much money from his trust account as we could to the U.S. Embassy, and they very quickly tried to move that onto his accounts and were successful.\" US ambassador to Russia John Sullivan speaks with the media outside the Moscow City Court in Moscow on June 15, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images) David estimated his brother would have enough money in his inmate account to last him for the next few months. But he said he feared the impacts of any additional sanctions on his brother\u2019s situation and their ability to regularly check up on him. \"I think the biggest concerns right now are the ability for the U.S. Embassy to continue to operate in Moscow. It's a key ally for us to be able to support Paul,\" Whelan continued. \"If he can't communicate with us, can't receive mail or packages from us, then he really is isolated. He's an American citizen who doesn't speak Russian in a Russian labor colony. I think everybody can imagine how awful.\" Whelan said his brother is largely unaware of the ongoing conflict, as he is only exposed to Russian-sponsored television, if at all. Asked how he felt the war could stymie his family\u2019s and the government\u2019s efforts to bring Paul home safely, he said: \"It complicates things.\" \"I don't know that Paul's case is necessarily off the stove,\" he went on. \"It may just be on the back burner for a while.\" WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 30: \u00a0Joey Reed and Paula Reed, the parents of Trevor Reed, a U.S. Marine who is currently being detained in a Russian prison, demonstrate in Lafayette Park near the White House on March 30, 2022, in Washington, DC.\u00a0 (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Trevor Reed, a now-30-year-old U.S. Marine Corps. veteran and former presidential security guard, had been living in Russia for the summer of 2019 when was arrested by Russian police and accused of assaulting a police officer. He had been celebrating in a park with his longtime Russian girlfriend and her colleagues at the time, his father, Joey Reed, told Fox News Digital. \"He was extremely intoxicated because they\u2019d been to a party for her law firm in a park,\" he explained. \"Everyone knew him because he\u2019d been there all summer in and out of the office all day long.\" At the time, Reed had been taking Russian language classes for an international studies degree through the University of North Texas, his father said. \"He got sick. They stopped to let him get out \u2026 They\u2019re kind of corralling him and, one of the people called the police,\" Reed went on. \"From then on, everything else is a lie, based on witnesses, based on video, based on expert witnesses who examined what little evidence that Russians allowed in courtroom.\" Police officers escort US ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, into a courtroom prior to a hearing in Moscow on March 11, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by ALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP via Getty Images) Reed\u2019s girlfriend and her colleagues followed police, who had taken Reed into custody, to the police station, where they were told to return at 9 a.m. to pick him up after he had sobered up. \"He should have never gone to the police station under Russian law. He was supposed to have been taken to a hospital,\" Reed said. When the woman returned to the police station with her mother at 9 a.m., they were greeted by agents from the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). \"She was frantic,\" Reed said. The concerned parents called the U.S. Embassy and ultimately hired the best lawyers they could. Russian law enforcement accused Reed of drunkenly grabbing an officer\u2019s arm and elbowing another while inside a police car on the way to the station.

(Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) Within months, the Reeds\u2019 lawyers, including one who was a retired judge, told them: \"Something\u2019s not right here.\" Reed said he later heard from top government officials, \"We\u2019re being told from the top people of Moscow to keep the heaviest charges on him and make sure that he\u2019s convicted.\" At his arraignment, Reed told the judge: \"Your honor, I don't remember anything that happened. I would never intentionally try and hurt a police officer. All my friends are police officers.\" His father said. \"He said, \u2018If you can show me that I did this, I'll plead guilty \u2026 and beg for mercy from the court.\" Following a public trial, Reed was convicted in July 2020 of assaulting police officers and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Much like the Whelan family, the Reeds meet with the U.S. government once a week to discuss their son\u2019s case. Joey Reed said they work with people who are assigned to nothing but handling their son\u2019s case. He said they also speak with the Whelan family regularly. Alina Tsybulnik (C), girlfriend of US ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, reacts during verdict hearing at Moscow's Golovinsky district court on July 30, 2020. His time in Russian prisons and labor camps has been concerning, the family said. \"He was essentially in solitary confinement, I believe, for over a year in a pretty bad prison,\" Reed said. \"Once he got to the labor camp \u2026 they would wake him up every hour. You know, they were punishing him for different things.\" He added: \"My son saw the sun maybe a dozen times in two years.\" Trevor pushed back against Russian authorities\u2019 efforts to make him work at the labor camp, telling them: \"I\u2019m not working for you. You\u2019ve taken me hostage, and I\u2019m not going to make stuff for you to make money on.\" Absent of a stricter housing facility within the camp, authorities have begun to accuse Reed of false violations that land him in solitary confinement.

And they make up reasons for it. But the real reason is you're refusing to work,\" Reed said. \"So, my son spent the first seven months there, basically in solitary confinement for 14 to 21 days at a time, and then they let him out for two and then they put him back out on more false charges.\" Trevor is sporadically able to make phone calls and communicate with his girlfriend or the embassy, but the correspondence is irregular and infrequent, Reed said. \"Our only communications for 232 days were through his girlfriend and occasionally he would call his attorneys in Moscow,\" Reed went on. \"But they would not let him call the embassy or us.\" Authorities further claimed that Trevor did not have the necessary calling card, then didn\u2019t have enough money on the card to make calls, and then would only allow him to speak on the phone in Russian. Trevor\u2019s situation has grown recently concerning in recent months after he grew ill with active tuberculosis and then began continuously coughing up blood. Reed said Russian authorities have recently refused to re-test Reed for active tuberculosis, despite Russian-sponsored media reports that have claimed that they did so several times. He was hospitalized for 10 days before he was returned to the camp and placed in solitary confinement once again. \"He\u2019s been sick almost the whole time he's been there,\" Reed said. \"You're not supposed to be put in solitary confinement if you're sick or injured, and he's both.\" On March 28, Trevor began a hunger strike in protest of his condition, prompting his concerned parents to travel from their home in Texas to Washington, D.C. to further embark on their media campaign in support of their son. Four days after the hunger strike began, Trevor was back in a hospital, where he called his girlfriend and said he had lost seven pounds since it started. Despite that the hospital usually provides Reed with opportunities to make outgoing calls, Trevor\u2019s girlfriend has not heard from him since. On Thursday, the family posted on a Twitter account \"Free Trevor Reed,\" writing: \"To the Russian Govt: Please let us speak to our son so we know he is alive and his condition.\" Earlier this week, the family said they had not received proof that their son was alive in almost a week. \"Our son is out of time,\" the family wrote. \"We are urgently calling on the Russian government to provide proof-of-life and resume allowing Trevor to call us. Our son is critically ill \u2013 this is not the time for cruelty for cruelty\u2019s sake.\" Reed told Fox News Digital that Reed\u2019s condition is \"getting worse and worse and we\u2019re able to help less and less.\" \"We\u2019re just afraid that we\u2019ve got to get our son back before he dies or has more charges put on him,\" Reed said. \"He\u2019s innocent.\" Brittney Griner is pictured in an undated photo after her arrest.

She is believed to be detained in a facility near Moscow, U.S. State Department officials have said. At the time, Griner, a 31-year-old WNBA star with the Phoenix Mercury, \u00a0was trying to return to the U.S. during a break in the Russian league.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price has said the U.S. \"will do everything we can to see that she is treated fairly throughout this ordeal,\" according to the report. Griner\u2019s wife did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for an interview. Multiple reports have indicated people close to her have chosen to stay quiet to prevent any hindrances in Griner\u2019s case. Stephanie Pagones is a Digital Reporter for FOX Business and Fox News.

The bill would criminalise performing an abortion in almost all cases, except where it could \"save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency\". Medical professionals convicted under the laws face fines of up to $100,000 (\u00a376,505) and 10 years in prison. It comes as the US Supreme Court weighs a case that could overturn abortion rights across the US later this year. Oklahoma's House of Representatives, in which Republicans hold a supermajority, voted to send the bill to the governor's office by 70 votes to 14. The state's Governor Kevin Stitt will be presented with the bill for his approval. The Republican has already committed to signing into law any legislation that restricts abortion rights. Republican Rep Jim Olsen, who authored the bill, said he was \"thrilled\" by its passage and said the legislation could see \"many lives of babies saved\". But pro-choice groups say the bill is a devastating blow for women, noting it comes after the state became a major destination for women from neighbouring Texas seeking abortions after the passage of extremely restrictive laws in the state last year. \"Nearly half of the patients Oklahoma providers are currently seeing are medical refugees from Texas,\" a coalition of pro-choice groups said. \"Now, Oklahomans could face a future where they would have no place left in their state to go to seek this basic health care.\" Tamya Cox-Toure, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, said in a statement the bill serves as an \"alarming reminder that the days of access to safe and legal abortion may be numbered, and we must continue to fight to guarantee all people have access to the essential health care they need, including abortion\". Republican dominated legislatures have been passing a series of restrictive abortion measures in recent years, designed to set up a showdown in the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. The court is due to rule by the end of June on a case involving a Republican-backed Mississippi law which could see conservative justices overturn the Roe v Wade decision that legalised abortion under federal law in 1973. The ruling could cut off abortion services for tens of millions of women and likely see similar laws bar abortion in nearly two dozen states. By Angelica Casas, BBC News, Texas The latest tactic in anti-abortion legislation is to target and punish providers. When Texas last year passed the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, some abortion providers I spoke to shut their services altogether, fearing reprimand. People seeking abortions were forced to find alternative options, like accessing abortion pills and travelling out of state. Nearly half of Texans who left the state went to Oklahoma. That may no longer be an option once this law goes into effect there later this year. \"Legislation like SB 612 on its face is very chilling to people's willingness to practise in states that are this hostile to providers,\" says Zachary Gingrich-Gaylord of Trust Women, one of four abortion clinics in Oklahoma. \"That's the point.\" Supporters of the law, like State Senator Nathan Dahm, have boasted that the measure is now the \"strongest pro-life legislation in the country\". And they point out the law does not penalise women but the providers. Trust Women has long depended on medical professionals from out of state to perform abortions because, they say, it's difficult to find local providers willing to go public about where they work. \"It makes it difficult to bring on even support staff in the clinic at a time that we're seeing an increased volume of patients,\" says Gingrich-Gaylord told me.

The President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking forward to doing that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Psaki told reporters en route to Fort Worth aboard Air Force One. Trevor Reed has been detained in Russia since 2019. He was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the \u201a\u00c4\u00falife and health\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of Russian police officers after a night of drinking. He and his family have denied the charges and US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan called the trial \u201a\u00c4\u00fatheater of the absurd.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerned the invasion of Ukraine will worsen his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fate, along with that of Paul Whelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. The Reed family, who met with Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan last December, has said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been asking for the meeting with the President for months. Shortly after Psaki said a presidential meeting was in the works, Joey Reed told CNN the family has not had any new communication with the White House. Jon Franks, a spokesman for the Reed family, said Psaki\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statements were very welcome. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are grateful they seem to have reconsidered and await details. Just a reminder that the Reeds gratefully acknowledged their meeting with NSA Sullivan when it took place back in December. They look forward to gratefully acknowledging a meeting with their President,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Franks said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe want to talk to the President and say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the only man in the world who can bring him home and you can do it today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said Tuesday before the White House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Joey Reed said he heard Monday that the meeting during Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s trip on Tuesday would not happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we were told second hand was that there wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI know that every second is planned out for the President every day, but three minutes? Three or four minutes? I think he could spare that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trevor Reed has said in recent weeks that he is coughing up blood, and his family is concerned he has tuberculosis. Joey Reed said he spoke with his son as recently as Monday and asked Trevor if he wanted to pass along a message to Biden. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have anything to say to the President. I think that they have forgotten about me,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have not (forgotten about him). We love our son and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to fight to our dying day to bring him home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Brianna Keilar on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wednesday that they spoke with Trevor again Wednesday morning. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe called us again this morning. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been sounding horrible, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coughing constantly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd then we had even worse news this morning, he called and could barely talk. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s had some sort of accident and he believes he might have broken a rib.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed also said Trevor told them he would be sent to a hospital prison on Friday to be checked and while he believed Trevor has been honest about his health, expressed uncertainty that his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s injury was an accident. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt just seems to be getting worse and worse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Whelan, a former United States Marine, was sentenced to 16 years in prison on an espionage charge he vehemently denies. Whelan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family has said in recent days that the US should not forget about him and Reed as the US discusses Russian sanctions. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are watching the impact of sanctions, expected retaliation by the Russian Federation government, and making what contingency plans we can to support him,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Paul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s brother, David Whelan wrote in a statement released late last week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPaul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wrongful detention has always been about the Russian Federation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government extracting concessions from the US government.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the Russian Federation demands the concession of sanction removal, let Paul and Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s freedom be part of the price the Russian authorities pay in return,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 David Whelan added in the statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur family will be expressing this view to members of Congress, the State Department, and the White House.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. This week, the White House has turned some of its focus to Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention of American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner has been detained in Russia after customs officials detected cannabis oil in the athlete\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s luggage at an airport near Moscow, according to the Russian Federal Customs Service. According to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the administration is working on the process to get her out of Russia. The White House, so far, has publicly declined to discuss Griner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention or their potential efforts to secure her release.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Navy that once wanted smaller, speedy warships to chase down pirates has made a speedy pivot to Russia and China \u2013 and many of those recently built ships could be retired. The U.S. Navy wants to decommission nine ships in the Freedom-class of littoral combat ships \u2013 warships that cost about $4.5 billion to build. THE PENTAGON IS INVESTIGATING EXTREMISM IN THE MILITARY. HERE\u2019S HOW BAD THE PROBLEM IS The Navy contends in its budget proposal that the move would free up $50 million per ship annually for other priorities. But it would also reduce the size of the fleet that\u2019s already surpassed by China in sheer numbers, something that could cause members of Congress to balk. Adm. Mike Gilday, chief of naval operations, defended the proposal that emphasizes long-range weapons and modern warships, while shedding other ships ill-equipped to face current threats.

BIDENS HONOR THE NAVY'S NEW SUBMARINE AT CEREMONY FOR USS DELAWARE All told, the Navy wants to scrap 24 ships, including five cruisers and a pair of Los Angeles-class submarines, as part of its cost-cutting needed to maintain the existing fleet and build modern warships. Those cuts surpass the proposed nine ships to be built. Most of them are older vessels. However, the littoral combat ships that are targeted are young. The oldest of them is 10 years old. NAVY IDS OFFICER KILLED IN E-2D HAWKEYE CRASH OFF VIRGINIA The littoral combat ship program was announced after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The ships topped 50 mph (80 kph) \u2013 fast enough to chase down pirates \u2013 and were highly maneuverable, even in shallow water, thanks to steerable waterjets instead of propellers. The ships were supposed to be made versatile through plug-and-play mission modules for surface combat, mine-sweeping operations or anti-submarine warfare. But those mission modules were beset by problems, and the anti-submarine capability was canceled in the new budget. Crew members of the USS Sioux City, a Freedom-class of littoral combat ship, gather before the ship's commissioning ceremony on Nov. 17, 2018, at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) And what about that speed? The fastest ship can\u2019t outrun missiles, and firing up those marine turbines for an extra burst of speed turned the ships into gas guzzlers, analysts said. Early versions also were criticized as too lightly armed and armored to survive combat. The speedy Freedom-class ships proposed for decommissioning feature a traditional steel hull. That entire class of ships suffers from a propulsion defect that will be costly to repair. The Navy proposes keeping a second variant, the aluminum Independence class. SUPREME COURT WON'T PROTECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, BUT NAVY SEALS NEVER QUIT U.S. Senate Armed Services Chair Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said the program was plagued by troubles from the start, and that \"moving forward the Navy must avoid similar acquisition disasters.\" U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Virginia, was more blunt, tweeting that it \"sucks\" to be decommissioning so many ships, especially newer ones. \"The Navy owes a public apology to American taxpayers for wasting tens of billions of dollars on ships they now say serve no purpose,\" she said. A sailor salutes from the USS Sioux City during the ship's commissioning ceremony, Nov. 17, 2018, in Annapolis, Maryland. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) Some detractors proclaimed littoral combat ships to be the Navy\u2019s \"Little Crappy Ship,\" but that\u2019s not fair, said defense analyst Loren Thompson. \"It\u2019s not a little crappy ship. It does what it was supposed to do. What it was supposed to do isn\u2019t enough for the kind of threats that we face today,\" said Thompson, from the Lexington Institute. In the Navy\u2019s defense, threats shifted swiftly from the Cold War to the war on terror to the current Great Power Competition in which Russia and China are asserting themselves, he said. NAVY AIRCRAFT CRASHES IN VIRGINIA WATERS; TWO RESCUED, ONE CONFIRMED DEAD: REPORT In the end, the Navy may be content with smaller numbers of Freedom-class ships for maritime security and small surface combatant operations, said Bryan Clark, defense analyst at the Hudson Institute. Congress must sign off on the Navy\u2019s proposal to decommission ships ahead of their projected service life. The House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday grilled Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the proposal.

Rob Wittman, R-Va., suggested the ship cuts were \"grossly irresponsible\" when the U.S. Navy has dipped from 318 ships to 297, while the Chinese fleet has grown from 210 to 360 ships over the past two decades. Milley said it\u2019s important to focus on the Navy\u2019s capabilities rather than the size of its fleet.

Data on purchases by foreign buyers in Canada is limited, but research suggests they amount for a small fraction of the market. \"I don't think\u00a0it's going to have a huge\u00a0impact,\" said Ben Myers, president of advisory firm Bullpenn Research & Consulting in Toronto, who found foreigners accounted for just 1% of purchases in 2020, down from 9% in 2015 and 2016. \"It's a fairly low number and let's face it, the people that really want to buy ... are going to find alternative ways to do it.\" Mr Myers said the soaring housing costs reflect strong population growth and a shortage of supply, due in part to rules that restrict development. The issues have worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers in Canada and elsewhere slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, lowering borrowing costs and boosting demand even further. The moves have fuelled the soaring housing prices seen in many markets around the world, but in Canada the disconnect between home prices and incomes is one of the most dramatic, according to OECD data. Mr Trudeau pledged to tackle housing affordability during his campaign for election last year. In addition to the temporary ban on foreign buyers, the budget proposal his government unveiled on Thursday sets aside billions to spur new construction and proposes new programmes, such as a tax-free savings account for first-time buyers. This video can not be played Why it takes 30 years to buy a house in Canada Mr Trudeau has also discussed banning certain bidding processes that favour investors, who by some measures have accounted for about one in five homes purchased in Canada since 2014. The proposed ban on foreign buyers would exempt permanent residents and foreign students and workers, as well as those buying their primary residence. The proposal builds on actions such as special taxes that some parts of Canada have already taken against out-of-town and foreign buyers. In Ontario, for example, provincial Premier Doug Ford recently announced plans to raise an existing tax on foreign buyers from 15% to 20% and expand it beyond Toronto to the entire province. While foreign purchases are not the driver of the affordability issues, taxing them at least captures revenue that can be re-deployed to address such problems, said Steve Pomeroy, head of Focus Consulting, a housing policy firm. \"If you ban them, you don't really have much of an impact on suppressing rising home prices and you give up the revenue,\" he said. New Zealand introduced a similar measure banning foreign buyers in 2018. \"It's good politics because it's easy to blame a victim that nobody cares about,\" Mr Pomeroy added. \"I don't think it will have much of an impact.\" Paul Kershaw, professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, also said he saw little in  Mr Trudeau's proposal likely to slow price increases or significantly address affordability. \"It's not clear the housing measures will be sufficient to break Canada's addiction to high and rising home prices,\" he said, noting that for existing homeowners, the high prices help amass wealth. Mr Pomeroy said he does expect price appreciation to slow in coming months, as the central bank raises interest rates. The Canadian housing market is particularly susceptible to such moves, since many buyers rely on five-year mortgages rather than the long-term ones common in the US and UK. But higher interest rates will only make it less affordable for prospective buyers trying to break into the market, he warned. Mr Myers said over the long-term, he expects hot markets such as Toronto and Vancouver to become dominated by renters, as regular buyers get priced out of the market, unless politicians address supply. But Mr Pomeroy said high development costs means that adding supply will not necessarily reduce prices, unless the additions are dramatic. \"Unless you've got born into the right family ... the prospects for young buyers are quite dim,\" he said.

Sharif, the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-N party and younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, received 174 out of 342 votes in Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote in parliament and is set to serve as prime minister until the next general election, which is expected to take place in 2023. All of Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lawmakers from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party resigned en masse in protest ahead of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote, and there will now have to be urgent elections to replace them. Following the vote, Khan called on his supporters to take to the streets. His next rally is scheduled for April 16 in Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan. In a speech to parliament ahead of his swearing in, Sharif spoke of unity across the country, including his coalition government. He said he would introduce a 10% increase in pensions and raise the monthly minimum wage rate to Rs 25,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec equivalent to US $136 per month. India\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Sharif in a Twitter post that added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIndia desires peace and stability in a region free of terror, so that we can focus on our development challenges and ensure the well-being and prosperity of our people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s appointment as the 31st prime minister of Pakistan comes after widespread protests in support of Khan erupted across Pakistan late Sunday. Tens of thousands took to the streets in key cities, including Lahore and Peshawar, to support the ousted leader. They chanted slogans against the United States \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which Khan had claimed was involved in a conspiracy against him \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s powerful military, which had seemed to withdraw its support from him. Against this backdrop of political turmoil and a crumbling economy, Sharif now faces a challenging period as the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader. Unlike Khan, Sharif has maintained an amicable relationship with the military and was a popular chief minister of Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s politically important and most populous province of Punjab. He was lauded for his ambitious administrative and infrastructure projects in the province, which saw advances in the education and industrial sectors. Sharif was instrumental in driving the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a part of China\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Belt and Road Initiative, and maintains a positive relationship with Beijing. A member of the wealthy Sharif dynasty, which amassed millions by producing steel, his family was mired in scandal after his brother Nawaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison and handed a $10.5 million fine over corruption charges in 2018. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan ousted as country's leader following vote of no-confidence Shehbaz Sharif rejected the verdict, calling it \u201a\u00c4\u00faflawed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapolitically motivated.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shehbaz Sharif is also facing charges for alleged corruption. In recent months, Sharif had led a campaign to remove Khan as Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader over claims of economic mismanagement and poor governance. Along with the opposition, he had urged Khan to resign ahead of a no-confidence vote that was widely expected to dismiss Khan. Tensions smoldered for days, with Khan repeatedly rejecting the criticism and instead claiming the moves against him were an attempt at regime change backed by Washington and some members of the opposition. The allegations were denied by both the US State Department and the Pakistani opposition. In a dramatic series of events, the deputy speaker in parliament blocked the no-confidence vote against Khan. Khan then dissolved parliament and called for early elections. The opposition challenged Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s moves in Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court, with Sharif calling them \u201a\u00c4\u00fanothing short of high treason.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The court ruled last week that the blocking of the no-confidence vote against Khan was unconstitutional, paving the way for Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rise to power.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Scripts are assembled on the coffee table in front of her; pen in hand, she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s making some last-minute notes. The city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bustling streets make a faint hum outside her hotel suite windows overlooking New York\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s iconic Central Park, but she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s too busy to notice \u201a\u00c4\u00ec she has work to do. In just a matter of days, she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll take the stage for what she says is the most important role of her career: as Roxie Hart in Bob Fosse\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s musical \u201a\u00c4\u00faChicago.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just threw myself into rehearsals,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she told CNN. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd it was six, seven, maybe eight hours a day. I was doing four hours of dance, one hour voice, two hours of acting \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 Then I came to New York and got thrown right into it with David Bushman and the director. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m doing this, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m doing this!\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s incredible because I didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t realize \u201a\u00c4\u00ec obviously, your voice, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a muscle, and so every day my voice is getting stronger and stronger to the point where I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just looking behind me going, who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s singing like that?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Anderson says she was first approached about the role 11 years ago the timing wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t right. Raising her kids without the help of a nanny, she said she didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to leave her two sons. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even imagine that was something I could do,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faEspecially with young kids. My kids were early teens at that time.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But she says the stars aligned when she got the call from acclaimed Broadway producer Barry Weissler just a few months ago. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll step onto the stage for the first time in the iconic role on Tuesday at the Ambassador Theater. Anderson, who was born and raised in the small Canadian town of Ladysmith, got her start in Hollywood as a model and went on to become one of the most recognizable Playboy stars, having landed her first cover on the magazine in 1989. She made her acting debut in ABC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faHome Improvement,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but then landed the role that made her a household name: C.J. Parker on \u201a\u00c4\u00faBaywatch,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 which she starred on for five seasons until 1997. Over the course of her career she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s had countless television roles and in 1996 a leading film role in \u201a\u00c4\u00faBarb Wire.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But when it comes to the stage, this is a first. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m gonna be so nervous,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she smiles. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut I also love the live audience. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done a little bit of public speaking like at Oxford and Cambridge about veganism and things like that \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 so I think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m really going to love it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Anderson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name has been in the zeitgeist of conversation in recent months, with the recent streaming series regarding an infamous videotape and everyone waiting for her to break her silence. But she has yet to address it publicly. Instead, she says, she made the purposeful decision to return to the spotlight with her craft. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI was just on my little ranch in Canada with my dogs and my gardens and everything. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been a long time since I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done anything, but I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve never done anything at this level.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Anderson then stands up and walks to two adjacent closets filled with designer clothing. She begins holding up dresses, jackets and blouses that all look a bit familiar. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because they are. Anderson shipped her most iconic looks from the 90s to wear in New York. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI never shop,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she says, holding a Chanel jacket. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is all from stuff that I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve had for forever. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m only shopping in my closet,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she laughs. Anderson says the preparation for \u201a\u00c4\u00faChicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 has been all-encompassing \u201a\u00c4\u00ec she even finds herself waking up in the middle of the night, reciting her monologue. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m dreaming and I wake up and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just talking. And then I go, okay, that was interesting. I go back to sleep and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s just like, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m dancing in my mind,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not a dancer. So I had to kind of put all this together. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even know how I did it. The show is very physical. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m doing the original choreography, which I think doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always happen. So they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re giving me everything and you get one thing and they give you more. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2No! I just learned this. Now there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a whole exit dance?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 My head, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to explode. But I do it. And then I get it. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Okay, I got this.\u201a\u00c4\u00f2\u201a\u00c4\u00fas After about 30 minutes responding to questions, Anderson trails off, staring at a towering pile of papers on the other side of her sprawling hotel suite. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s her long-awaited memoir. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also doing a documentary with Netflix. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen I was a lot younger, I took my power back in certain situations, and it feels the same way [now],\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt feels like another step closer to taking my power back and really taking it back. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s very empowering. And it does feel I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m being supported. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m being rooted for, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a new feeling for me. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to let anybody down, but I also really don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to let myself down.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 As for all of the recent attention she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s getting, she says she believes this Broadway role \u201a\u00c4\u00famight be the beginning of something really interesting for me.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd in a way where I feel respected, honored, all those weird things that I never felt before. So it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a very strange feeling \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I always knew, even as a young girl, I remember at five years old thinking that I was going to do something that was going to be unexpected. \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 not to prove people wrong, but just to prove to myself that I was much more capable of something great.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The five-time Masters champion had to overcome a poor start to his round, before an up-and-down back nine helped him recover and put him in a tie for 19th. It marks his 22nd consecutive cut at the famed tournament, one shy of the record held by Fred Couples and Gary Player. It came on a day of thrills and spills, including a hole-in-one for a veteran golfer and a player losing his club head after hitting the ball. But eventually, Woods carded a two-over 74 to finish at one over for the tournament so far and ensure he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be playing over the weekend. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWell, I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t feel as good as I would like to feel. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s OK,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Woods told the media afterward. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAs I said, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got a chance going into the weekend. Hopefully I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll have one of those light bulb moments and turn it on in the weekend and get it done. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve seen guys do it with a chance going into the back nine. If you are within five or six going into the back nine, anything can happen. I need to get myself there. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the key. I need to get myself there. \u201a\u00c4\u00faTomorrow will be a big day. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be cool. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be tough. Again, the wind is supposed to blow again and tough scoring conditions. I need to go out there and handle my business and get into the red and get myself a chance going into that back nine on Sunday.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Scottie Scheffler \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who was recently named world No. 1 after a run of excellent form \u201a\u00c4\u00ec produced a late burst with a five-under par 67 Friday, to shoot into the lead at the halfway point of the Masters, with an overall eight-under par 136 and a five-stroke lead, a record after 36 holes. Woods capped off a remarkable comeback to golf Thursday as he carded a one-under 71 in the opening round at Augusta National. The 46-year-old Woods displayed all his poise and experience to finish near the top of the leaderboard, just four shots behind leader Im Sung-jae at the end of the day. As he looks to complete what would be another fairy-tale story and make the cut in his first appearance in a professional golf tournament since his February 2021 car crash, Woods hoped for more of the same on day two of the 2022 Masters. With a large crowd watching on and anticipation in the air, the 15-time major winner stepped up and blasted his ball down the first hole, only for it to find the bunker on the right of the fairway. He would end up bogeying the opening hole, moving him back to even par for the tournament. And his slow start to the second round continued over the next two holes, rescuing a par on the par-five second hole before missing a short putt on the third hole for his second bogey in three holes, putting him at one over par. Unfortunately for Woods, another bogey was to follow on the par-three fourth hole, when his par putt fell just inches short. According to the PGA Tour, the three-over through four holes start is Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 worst score through four holes in 92 career rounds at the Masters Tournament. It got worse for Woods still, as another bogey on the fifth hole dropped him to three over for the tournament. However, from there, Woods slowly recovered. He earned hard-fought pars on holes 6 and 7 before a vital birdie on the eighth hole helped drag him back to two over. And the recovery only got better from there, with the shot of his second round so far coming on the 10th hole, leaving him with a very short putt for a second birdie in three holes, which dragged him to one over. But just when it looked like he was on the way back, things took a turn for the worse for Woods. Following his birdie on the 10th, he carded two successive bogeys on the 11th and 12th as the wind swirled around and undid his recent hard work. However, the roller coaster continued over the next two holes. Having picked up two successive bogeys, Woods collected two successive birdies to once again position himself at one over par. Woods did manage to wrestle some sense of stability to his round over the final four holes of his round, finishing with four straight pars to leave him with a two over par 74. After the rocky opening he went through \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including four bogeys in five holes \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it is a testament to Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 fighting spirit he was able to battle back and earn a chance to compete for the green jacket over the next two days. Nobody expected Woods to be playing at the Masters this year. Following a car crash in February 2021 in which he sustained serious leg injuries, he has only appeared in public on a golf course just once, at the PNC Championship in December with his son Charlie. Then Woods used a golf cart to help him get around the course. Speculation first began to mount regarding Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 participation in the tournament when his private jet was sighted landing at an airport near Augusta last week. And a few practice rounds before the Thursday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s opening round only heightened the rumor. Woods said on Monday it would \u201a\u00c4\u00fabe a game-time decision\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on whether he plays at the Masters. He confirmed his participation later in the week, and has been the main draw at the tournament \u201a\u00c4\u00ec drawing huge swathes of patrons and media attention \u201a\u00c4\u00ec as he makes his way around the Augusta National course.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Maxwell was convicted of trafficking girls and her lawyers want a new trial, arguing the jury were not impartial. Her case was thrown into disarray when this juror told the media he had told other jurors about his own abuse. The hearing in New York will establish whether or not Maxwell is retried. Maxwell, the daughter of a late British media tycoon, was convicted in December of grooming teenage girls for abuse by the late Jeffrey Epstein. She faces up to 65 years in prison but maintains her innocence. Epstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The juror in question, who asked to be identified by his first and middle name, Scotty David, was given immunity from prosecution earlier on Tuesday. When asked why he failed to disclose his past in the jury questionnaire when explicitly asked, he said it was an \"inadvertent mistake.\" \"This is one of the biggest mistakes I have made in my life,\" he added, saying he \"flew through\" the document and was \"super-distracted\" by everything going on around him in the jury room. After the conviction of Maxwell he had told reporters that he had shared his own experience of sexual abuse with jurors after some had questioned the recollections from two of Maxwell's accusers. This admission immediately prompted Maxwell's lawyers to demand a retrial. They argued that him sharing his experience with other jurors could have made them more sympathetic to her accusers and meant she never got a fair trial.

Ghost guns are one of many issues facing regulators and policymakers looking to address a spike in gun violence that began in early summer 2020. Gun homicides drove the uptick. Here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what you should know about ghost guns: Ghost guns are untraceable, self-assembled firearms, often put together with parts sold online, sometimes in as little as 30 minutes. Growing ghost gun problem adds to America's violence woes The weapons, sometimes referred to by officials as \u201a\u00c4\u00faprivately made firearms,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or PMFs, do not have serial numbers, making them all the more difficult to track and regulate. Purchasing kits to build ghost guns online does not require a background check, so buyers can sidestep the typical requirements that might come with buying a firearm. This means anyone \u201a\u00c4\u00ec no matter their age or criminal record \u201a\u00c4\u00ec can buy the kits and assemble a weapon. Calls for something to be done about ghost guns have grown as their use in shootings across the US has proliferated, with the weapons recovered at crime scenes in some big cities more frequently. While ghost guns make up a relatively small percentage of the total number of guns recovered by law enforcement, officials in several cities have reported sharp increases in those tallies, a CNN analysis of 2021 data found. In San Francisco, for example, about 20% of the nearly 1,100 guns it seized in 2021 were ghost guns, police there told CNN. And New York is on pace to again shatter the previous year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total, according to data shared with CNN. Since the start of this year, the NYPD has recovered 163 ghost guns, compared to 29 over the same period in 2021, mayor Eric Adams said Monday. In 2021, New York authorities seized 4,497 firearms \u201a\u00c4\u00ec  375, or 8.33%, were ghost guns. Of the 12,088 guns recovered in Chicago last year, 455, or 3.76%, were ghost guns, according to data from the city, up from 130 ghost guns recovered in 2020, when ghost guns made up 1.15% of the 11,343 guns recovered. Between 2016 and 2021, the ATF received 45,000 reports of privately made firearms recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations, including 20,000 reported last year alone. The agency was able to trace only 1% of the 45,000, officials said, because the firearms lack serial numbers. The number of guns the ATF traced rose from about 217,000 in 2015 to just over 393,000 in 2020. Just this past week, a ghost gun was recovered outside the home of a suspect arrested for the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old girl in the South Bronx, a police source told CNN. The regulation the Biden administration announced Monday addresses a gap in the government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to track ghost guns, requiring background checks before kit purchases and inclusion of serial numbers on some pieces used to assemble weapons. Biden to announce new gun regulation and name ATF nominee \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Biden administration is making sure these kits are treated as the deadly firearms they are,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 a senior administration official said ahead of the announcement. The new rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check, which is required for other kinds of firearm purchases. Those selling kits will also be required to include a serial number on the components that make up the weapon, so the eventual firearm can be traced. Additionally, the new rules mandate firearm dealers add a serial number to already-assembled ghost guns they come across. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no longer a ghost,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said in the Rose Garden on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt has a return address. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to help save lives, reduce crime and get more criminals off the streets.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN Political Briefing Podcast: Biden tackles gun violence At least 10 states and Washington, DC, have already taken steps to restrict or ban the purchase or use of ghost guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Maryland was the latest to join last week, when the governor allowed legislation to pass that altered the definition of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafirearm\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to include an unfinished frame or receiver and prohibiting the sale of such components, among other steps. Maryland joins 10 states and DC becoming latest to place restrictions on ghost guns Republican Gov. Larry Hogan thanked the legislature for addressing untraceable firearms in a letter. But he said the legislation did not go far enough to hold accountable those who actually commit shootings. Last October, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed legislation last October aimed at tackling the epidemic of gun violence, including prohibiting \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe sale of ghost guns and requiring gunsmiths and dealers in firearms to register firearms in their possession,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. In the meantime, federal authorities have been cracking down on those who are either in possession of ghost guns or looking to traffic them. Four men were charged in Baltimore last month with conspiracy and dealing firearms \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including ghost guns \u201a\u00c4\u00ec without a license, per the US Attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office in Maryland. In January, a Rhode Island man was charged by the US Attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office of the Southern District of New York for allegedly selling or attempting to sell more than 100 guns he made at his home. According to the Justice Department, the 34-year-old allegedly purchased the parts, made them at his home in Providence, Rhode Island, and then sold the completed weapons. He was charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic firearms and one count of making false statements, the DOJ said in a news release.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAfter 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians \u201a\u00c4\u00fahostage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration.

CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response. A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been \u201a\u00c4\u00faisolated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it \u201a\u00c4\u00fain any significant way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days.

That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing \u201a\u00c4\u00faseveral civilians\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fasidelines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe will fight to the end,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s famous wartime speech. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrengthen the sanctions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a terrorist state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. Zelensky's heroism is coming up against Western red lines \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stoltenberg. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe situation could spiral out of control,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe other half largely from inside Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA little bit more than 70\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles have been fired from Belarus, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faonly a half dozen or so\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A married California woman who allegedly claimed to have been abducted and beaten, prompting a massive police search effort, in an effort to spend time with a boyfriend was granted bail Tuesday. Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, California, was ordered held on a $120,000 bond Tuesday and will appear for a preliminary court hearing\u00a0on March 25, the Justice Department said. She is charged with making false statements to a law enforcement officer and mail fraud, which stems from 35 payments totaling $30,000 in victim's assistance funds. Papini vanished on Nov. 2, 2016, supposedly while on a jog. She was found 22 days later in Yolo County with a \"brand\" on her right should and bound, federal prosecutors said. She falsely claimed two Hispanic women had taken her at gunpoint, authorities said. CALIFORNIA KIDNAP CASE: MOM PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO POLICE BY FAMILY, REPORT SAYS Sherri Panini leaving her Redding, California, home a few months later after she claimed she was kidnapped. On Tuesday, a federal judge set her bail at $120,000.\u00a0 (Mega\u00a0) She even provided a description of the alleged abductors to an FBI sketch artist. \"In truth, Papini had been voluntarily staying with a former boyfriend in Costa Mesa and had harmed herself to support her false statements,\" according to a press release last week from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of California. Papini's husband reported her missing after she failed to pick their children up from daycare and he was unable to locate her, prosecutors said. She was found on Nov. 24, 2016, nearly 150 miles from home. She had lost a considerable amount of weight and her hair had been cut shorter, authorities said. She was also branded on her right shoulder, but the exact content of the brand was unclear, according to court documents. She was found had bruises on her face, arm, thigh, ligature marks on her wrists and ankles and burns on parts of her body. Upon her disappearance, Papini's husband went searching for her and found her cellphone and earbuds. When she re-emerged on Thanksgiving Day, investigators tested her underwear for DNA, and it matched an unknown male. When the sample was submitted to a database, investigators located a relative of the DNA donor, which eventually led them to her ex-boyfriend.

(FBI) The former boyfriend admitted to picking up Papini near where she was last seen and that he helped her create some of her injuries and burns, court documents said. During an interview with federal and local investigators, Papini was warned that it was a crime to lie to federal agents upon being presented with evidence that she had not been abducted. Instead of retracting the story, she allegedly doubled down. Fox News has reached out to Papini's attorney for comment. The multi-state search for her and the five-year search for who reportedly kidnaped her diverted resources from other cases, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said. In total, the investigation costs $150,000, by conservative estimates, he said in a Facebook post last week. \"Not only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters, but in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain,\" he wrote. \"All of law enforcement in Shasta county was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling this case.\" Undated photo of Sherri Papini.

But the reassurances haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t eased his wife\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerns. She says the technology is often jarring and anxiety-inducing. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m reading, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s when I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Oh good grief,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sadie Krueger told CNN Business. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt would be jerky or swerve just out of the blue. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Whoa, are you drunk?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Krueger says she loves their Tesla Model 3, but she feels that \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 drives closer to large trucks than most drivers, and sometimes steers into the wrong lane. The technology drives like a \u201a\u00c4\u00fagrandpa\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in some cases, irritating nearby drivers, she says, but other times can be aggressive. Tesla enthusiasts with the unfinished, test version of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 currently a driver-assist system akin to an enhanced cruise control, are finding that family and friends like Krueger don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always share their enthusiasm. The technology promises to one day drive passengers to their destinations without human intervention. Many tell CNN Business that they use the software less when driving with other people, including their romantic partners. Passengers sometimes object to what they describe as the jerky driving style of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and have asked the Tesla fans not to use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in the vehicle. Some Tesla owners are preemptively deciding to not turn on \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 so that passengers get a smoother ride. Krueger said she humors her husband, as he gets a kick out of testing the software near their California home. His YouTube channel has more than 42,000 subscribers who watch his videos on Tesla. But she draws a line, too, and has asked him not to use it when she rides with him in cities or where he knows it is likely to be jerky. But plenty of passengers, especially younger ones like Krueger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s teenage son, and tech junkies, are excited by the nascent technology, and savor the experience, flaws and all. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s said that lives will be transformed with safer roads and affordable transportation. Musk has described Teslas as \u201a\u00c4\u00faappreciating assets\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that should be worth as much as $200,000, and claims they could someday bring in up to $30,000 in gross profit as robotaxis in the automaker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposed future ridehail network. In Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pitch, robotaxis would operate like Uber or Lyft vehicles that could be summoned via a Tesla smartphone app. There would be no human driver behind the wheel. There might not even be a steering wheel or pedals in the vehicle. Some Tesla enthusiasts have purchased their vehicles with plans to use them as robotaxis in the future. But before Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s technology can change the world, it will first have to work, and then it will have to win over fans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 loved ones. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the reactions of family and friends of its beta testers. Tesla first released an early version of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to a small group in October 2021. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t really \u201a\u00c4\u00faself-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the eyes of regulators and autonomous vehicle experts. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s more like an enhanced cruise control that steers, accelerates and navigates intersections, but it needs an attentive human driver behind the wheel who can take control at any moment because of the system\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shortcomings. Drivers reported being both amazed and alarmed by the system, which sometimes shines, and in other cases makes seemingly dangerous decisions. Tesla owner Justin Demaree says he tries to use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as much as possible. He views it as historically significant work. Tesla cars with \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 send driving data back to the automaker, which uses it to refine the software. Demaree imagines a day when people may not even fly anymore because self-driving software gets so good. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt will change everything,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Demaree said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to pay attention, you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to do anything, you can spend that time with family or doing other things that are more productive or add more value.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But Demaree must reckon with the difference between the promised future and the current reality when his family gets in the car. He only uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 about half the time that he drives with his wife Heather. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s being temperamental, she doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to ask anymore,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Demarre said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just turn it off.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Walt Corey, 70, hopes he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll never have to turn off the \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 software while driving alone or with his wife, Nancy. He bought a Tesla in hopes of ensuring their mobility and independence as they age. He says she gets annoyed with the loud alarm that sounds to alert drivers when they need to immediately take control of the car because it can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t handle a situation. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really obnoxious,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Corey said, explaining that the noise bothers him as well. \u201a\u00c4\u00faLet me know if I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m about to drive off the cliff or hit somebody, but don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do it because the software gets confused.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jeff Goin, a pilot and self-described \u201a\u00c4\u00fatechno-geek,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 bought a Tesla in part because he felt that Autopilot, its driver-assist technology that is more rudimentary than \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 would make him feel less fatigued after long drives. Tesla owners generally say that using Autopilot\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s auto-steering function on divided highways leaves them less drained after hours on the road. But Goin doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He tried the software and felt he was having to pay even more attention when using it. Goin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s partner Tim uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 regularly. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHang on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin says he jokes to friends riding with them when Tim turns on \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 When the couple rides by themselves, Tim uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 less. Goin said he sometimes works in the car, so he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t like the distraction of being jostled. Even so, Goin says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s at times impressed with \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSometimes you get in there and you think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s come a long way. And then it stops on the railroad tracks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin said, describing a recent incident in which he says his Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 sensed a stop sign down the road and chose to stop earlier than advisable, briefly stopping on railroad tracks. Goin, who said he \u201a\u00c4\u00faimmensely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 admires CEO Elon Musk, is skeptical of how soon self-driving vehicles will be a reality. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time on the regular scale, minutes on a regular scale and then there are Musk minutes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin said. Though Musk has never wavered in his promise that self-driving Teslas are just around the corner, the challenge of building a fully autonomous vehicle has proven harder than those developing them expected. Building a robotaxi that drives safely isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough, either. Robotaxis will have to operate smoothly enough to make passengers like Goin comfortable. Many of them are unlikely to accept as many flaws as early adopters of technology. John Gibbs, a Georgia professor who says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s long tested beta software, is \u201a\u00c4\u00faused to seeing things break and behave weirdly and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Oh wow, I wonder what caused that,?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut there are people whose personality types are much less that.

Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the measure, which would bar teachers from teaching these topics to children under 10 years old. Critics say the bill will isolate LGBT youth. Proponents say it is about empowering parents on education issues. Activists have dubbed it the Don't Say Gay bill. It is officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Bill. The Republican-backed legislation passed on Tuesday. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics \"when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\". White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday decried the passing of \"hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students\". President Joe Biden and his administration are \"with LGBTQI+ students everywhere\", she wrote on Twitter. State laws that ban or constrain the discussion of LGBT life in classrooms - sometimes called \"no promo homo\" laws by critics - are not uncommon. Four US states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas - currently have laws on the books that explicitly prohibit or limit sex education to heterosexual activity. The Florida bill also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Representative Joe Harding, who sponsored the bill in Florida's statehouse, has said that the bill is simply about \"empowering parents\". Critics say that vague language in the law could result in teachers and students being prevented from discussing their lives even outside the classroom. \"This is really about making it impossible for LGBT young people to speak for themselves,\" said Nadine Smith, the executive director of advocacy group Equality Florida. Todd and Jeff Delmay - one of the first same-sex couples to get married in Florida - say this bill would make it impossible for their 11-year-old son Blake to talk freely about his dads. \"We have fought and won these battles to adopt children and to be a family and to be together,\" Todd told the BBC. \"And they are now trying to find every way in which they can erase us and our families.\" And the couple warned the bill could marginalise LGBT youth as they  come to terms with their identity. \"A child's need for acceptance in a safe space should always take precedence over some parents' belief,\" Todd said, adding that legal challenges were already under way. The Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative group that supports the bill, said in a statement last week that it was \"necessary because government schools in the US have become ideological, political and are more interested in shaping a child's politics and sexual inclinations than they are in teaching academics of reading, writing, math, and education\". Governor DeSantis - widely regarded as a possible 2024 White House contender - endorsed the bill last month, saying it was part of a wider effort to make the education system \"transparent\" to parents. The Florida bill is part of a fierce debate taking place across the US over children's education, how schools operate and what they teach. Why are certain books being banned in US?

Mohammed al-Qahtani, 46, was repatriated to Saudi Arabia after a review board determined that he no longer posed a \"significant threat\". The board noted his \"significantly compromised mental health condition\". Qahtani was tortured so badly by US interrogators after his detention in 2001 that he could not be put on trial. The review board said last month that a condition for his transfer should be his participation in Saudi Arabia's rehabilitation centre for jihadists, known as the Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef Centre for Counselling and Care, where he could receive comprehensive mental health care. US authorities have alleged that Qahtani was meant to be on board United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania after being hijacked by four al-Qaeda militants on 9/11. However, he had been prevented from entering the US the previous month. Qahtani was captured four months later on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and brought to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba in February 2002. Investigators there received approval to use \"more aggressive interrogation techniques\" on Qahtani after he resisted conventional methods. Between November 2002 and January 2003, he was subjected to prolonged isolation, sleep deprivation, sexual humiliation and exposure to cold. In 2009, a top official in then-President George W Bush's administration, Susan Crawford, told the Washington Post that Qahtani's treatment \"met the legal definition of torture\" and that she had decided to not refer him for prosecution as a consequence. \"This was not any one particular act; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him, that hurt his health. It was abusive and uncalled for. And coercive,\" she said. A psychiatrist hired by Qahtani's lawyers told a US court that the torture had aggravated a childhood brain injury and schizophrenia that he developed as an adolescent, according to the New York Times. The newspaper also cited court documents as saying that Qahtani had refused psychotropic medication and repeatedly tried to kill himself in recent years. The defence department said 38 detainees remained at Guantanamo following Qahtani's release. Nineteen are eligible for transfer, while 10 others are awaiting trial by military commissions, including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

The five-figure penalties on the two flyers accused of violence are part of $2m (\u00a31.5m) in fines levied this year. US airlines have seen record numbers of disruptive passengers since early 2021, with many incidents involving the refusal to wear an anti-viral facemask. The fines were announced by transport secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday. \"If you are on an airplane, don't be a jerk and don't endanger the flight crews and fellow passengers,\" he said in an appearance on ABC's The View. \"If you do, you will be fined by the FAA.\" In one incident, an American Airlines passenger travelling from Texas to North Carolina has been asked to pay a $81,950 fine for threatening to hurt a flight attendant. The attendant had offered to help the passenger after she fell into the aisle of the plane. The unnamed passenger then allegedly pushed an airline worker and tried to open the cabin door. While flight attendants attempted to restrain her, she repeatedly hit one staff member in the head. When she was placed in cuffs, \"she spit at, headbutted, bit and tried to kick the crew and other passengers\", the FAA said in a news release. In the other incident, the passenger was flying on Delta Air Lines from Las Vegas to Atlanta. She allegedly tried to \"hug and kiss the passenger seated next to her, walked to the front of the aircraft to try to exit during flight; refused to return to her seat; and bit another passenger multiple times\". That passenger, who is also unnamed, was physically restrained by crew members and has now been asked to pay a fine of $77,272. Neither incident involved a failure to adhere to Covid measures. In his interview with The View, Mr Buttigieg said the US would decide by 18 April on whether to extend the federal requirement to wear masks on planes and in airports. The FAA announced a \"zero-tolerance\" policy on unruly passengers in January 2021, and has issued some $7m in fines since then. They have recorded 7,060 air rage incidents and say around 70% involved masking rules. But the rate of incidents has now declined by 60% since its high last year.

The Reed family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attempt to set up a meeting with Biden ahead of the visit was declined, they said. Reed\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family stood near the road waving as Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s motorcade passed by before the President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s speech. Paula Reed, Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s mother, said she saw Biden acknowledge her from his vehicle. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat was the whole purpose of coming out here, to get his attention,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, saying it was \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 worth it.

She said Biden told them he felt terrible he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with them while he was in Texas and promised his scheduler would make an appointment for the family to meet with him in Washington.

The Reed family, who met with Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan last December, has said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been asking for the meeting with the President for months. Shortly after Psaki said a presidential meeting was in the works, Joey Reed told CNN the family has not had any new communication with the White House.

Three or four minutes? I think he could spare that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trevor Reed has said in recent weeks that he is coughing up blood, and his family is concerned he has tuberculosis. Joey Reed said he spoke with his son as recently as Monday and asked Trevor if he wanted to pass along a message to Biden. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have anything to say to the President. I think that they have forgotten about me,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have not (forgotten about him). We love our son and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to fight to our dying day to bring him home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Brianna Keilar on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wednesday that they spoke with Trevor again Wednesday morning. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe called us again this morning.

He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s had some sort of accident and he believes he might have broken a rib.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed also said Trevor told them he would be sent to a hospital prison on Friday to be checked and while he believed Trevor has been honest about his health, expressed uncertainty that his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s injury was an accident. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt just seems to be getting worse and worse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Whelan, a former United States Marine, was sentenced to 16 years in prison on an espionage charge he vehemently denies. Whelan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family has said in recent days that the US should not forget about him and Reed as the US discusses Russian sanctions. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are watching the impact of sanctions, expected retaliation by the Russian Federation government, and making what contingency plans we can to support him,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Paul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s brother, David Whelan wrote in a statement released late last week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPaul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wrongful detention has always been about the Russian Federation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government extracting concessions from the US government.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the Russian Federation demands the concession of sanction removal, let Paul and Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s freedom be part of the price the Russian authorities pay in return,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 David Whelan added in the statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur family will be expressing this view to members of Congress, the State Department, and the White House.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. This week, the White House has turned some of its focus to Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention of American basketball star Brittney Griner.

Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the measure, which would bar teachers from teaching these topics to children under 10 years old. Critics say the bill will isolate LGBT youth. Proponents say it is about empowering parents on education issues. Activists have dubbed it the Don't Say Gay bill. It is officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Bill. The Republican-backed legislation passed on Tuesday. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics \"when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\". White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday decried the passing of \"hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students\". President Joe Biden and his administration are \"with LGBTQI+ students everywhere\", she wrote on Twitter. State laws that ban or constrain the discussion of LGBT life in classrooms - sometimes called \"no promo homo\" laws by critics - are not uncommon. Four US states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas - currently have laws on the books that explicitly prohibit or limit sex education to heterosexual activity. The Florida bill also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Representative Joe Harding, who sponsored the bill in Florida's statehouse, has said that the bill is simply about \"empowering parents\". Critics say that vague language in the law could result in teachers and students being prevented from discussing their lives even outside the classroom. \"This is really about making it impossible for LGBT young people to speak for themselves,\" said Nadine Smith, the executive director of advocacy group Equality Florida. Todd and Jeff Delmay - one of the first same-sex couples to get married in Florida - say this bill would make it impossible for their 11-year-old son Blake to talk freely about his dads. \"We have fought and won these battles to adopt children and to be a family and to be together,\" Todd told the BBC. \"And they are now trying to find every way in which they can erase us and our families.\" And the couple warned the bill could marginalise LGBT youth as they  come to terms with their identity. \"A child's need for acceptance in a safe space should always take precedence over some parents' belief,\" Todd said, adding that legal challenges were already under way. The Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative group that supports the bill, said in a statement last week that it was \"necessary because government schools in the US have become ideological, political and are more interested in shaping a child's politics and sexual inclinations than they are in teaching academics of reading, writing, math, and education\". Governor DeSantis - widely regarded as a possible 2024 White House contender - endorsed the bill last month, saying it was part of a wider effort to make the education system \"transparent\" to parents. The Florida bill is part of a fierce debate taking place across the US over children's education, how schools operate and what they teach. Why are certain books being banned in US?

Jones is co-author of \u201a\u00c4\u00faSay it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 900AM WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN. Tiger Woods had already won the minute he walked onto that fairway at the 86th Masters golf tournament on Thursday and, for me, he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t need a sixth green jacket prize to prove it. It was just over a year ago when the world was stunned by the news that Woods had been in a horrible car accident in Los Angeles. Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 right leg nearly had to be amputated but was saved by emergency surgery. Afterward, many wondered whether Woods ever walk again, let alone play golf. This year, 2022, is the Year of the Tiger \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a year that signifies courage, bravery and resilience. And just perhaps, Woods had a feeling his fate would change this year, as he tweeted: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHappy Year of the Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 back in January. No one but Tiger could have imagined that just 14 months after his accident, the Hall of Fame golfer would be out of his wheelchair and competing in golf\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most prestigious tournament. Sometimes, winning isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t about trophies. It is about refusing to be defeated by adversity. Refusing to give in to hopelessness. Winning looks like Tiger Woods, battered but far from broken. Doctor: 'On paper' Tiger Woods shouldn't be able to play the Masters Personally, I feel connected to Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s journey back. As a young girl, a car accident left me bedridden and unable to walk for more than a year. Doctors told my mother I might not walk again \u201a\u00c4\u00ec but I was determined to prove them wrong. It was not easy. I leaned on my childlike faith, believing God would make me strong again. And I pushed through rehab \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and the hurtful taunts from neighborhood kids. Unlike Tiger, my dreams were small: learn to walk again, make the track team, become a cheerleader. I accomplished all three. Since then, anyone who has tried to limit my dreams gets the side-eye. Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 miraculous comeback reminds me of the lesson I learned early on: no one has power over me unless I allow it. On Thursday, Woods did not win the first round but he did remarkably well. He finished the opening round at 71, 1 under par. He was four strokes behind the leader, South Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Sungjae Im. Still, as we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve seen so many times, even when Woods is not winning, he elevates the game and everything around it, as evidenced by the huge crowds and intense media buzz in Augusta, Georgia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s definitely a different feel in tournaments that he tees it up in,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 golfer Patrick Cantlay, told Sky Sports. What Tiger Woods's close call makes clear They call it the \u201a\u00c4\u00faTiger Effect.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 And it has forever changed the way we see the game of golf. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s difficult to describe the impact Woods has had on the sport since his first Masters win in 1997, when he blew past his nearest competitor by a whopping 12 strokes \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a record at the time. Woods was just 21 years old. Since then, Woods has collected 82 PGA Tour wins, including 15 majors. His last big win came at his most recent major, the 2019 Masters, finishing 13 under par \u201a\u00c4\u00ec just after his fourth back surgery and fifth knee surgery. On top of all the wins, Woods became a cultural icon \u201a\u00c4\u00ec one of Madison Avenue\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hottest pitchmen \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and in the process, transformed his sport. Golf was no longer your father\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s or grandfather\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s game. Gone were the days of watching aging, mostly White men wearing \u201a\u00c4\u00fadad\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shorts, putting balls over their ever-expanding bellies. Fiji\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Vijay Singh, who won the Masters in 2000, was the one of the only nonwhite golfers on the pro tour back then. Tiger made golf cool for younger generations. And all around the world, young and not-so-young Tiger-wannabes started sprouting up, especially among Black and brown players. Everyone, men and women, and children dreamed of playing like Tiger. Can Tiger Woods win the Masters? Hear what CNN reporter thinks It should be noted that history was made on Thursday, for the first time in 86 years at the Masters, we saw three Black golfers in tournament \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Harold Varner III, Cameron Champ and Woods. Both Varner and Champ grew up idolizing Tiger. Tony Finau, who is of Tongan and Somoan descent, also played. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI dreamed since I was a kid of competing against Tiger, playing against him at the Masters \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what my dreams were made of as a kid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finau told golf.com about the first time he played with Woods, back in 2019 at the Masters. Finau said he picked up his first golf clubs in 1997 after watching Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s historic win in Augusta. In golf, there is Before Tiger and After Tiger. Before Tiger, most sports fans and sports reporters argued over whether golf was even a real sport. Most agreed, it was not. But then along came Woods, bringing his game of power and distance, smashing golf balls, talking about training regimens and weight lifting workouts. Woods dominated his competitors so completely that suddenly golf courses were being redesigned or as some put it, \u201a\u00c4\u00faTiger proofed.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Tiger Woods: Five-time Masters winner shoots one-under 71 in first round after return from injury Most golf courses were lengthened by thousands of feet to try to level the playing field \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Woods and his power game had made old course designs too easy. Golf became a game built for strong, young players in top condition. And any pro golfer who couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t keep up with the Tiger proofing, quickly fell out of contention. Woods turned golf into a spectator sport, and now, when he plays, television ratings spike. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s why media outlets began jockeying for rights to broadcast golf majors and advertisers clamored for buy-in. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also changed the game in other ways. Back in 1997, Woods won the Masters and took home $486,000 from the total shared prize fund of $2.7 million. Just before the pandemic hit in 2019, Wood\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Master\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s win topped $2 million, out of a total record-breaking prize fund of $11.5 million. (This year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s prize money is expected to be the same as 2019). Woods has made the men around him millionaires. Before his rise, there were fewer than 10 golfers who earned more than a million dollars. But by 2018, more than 100 players were topping the million-dollar mark. By 2009, Woods had become the first-ever billion-dollar athlete, topping his good friend Michael Jordan. A look back at Tiger Woods' triumph, tragedy and trauma Nike and other brands have made a fortune designing updated golf clubs and other merchandise for the game, including more fashionable golf wear featuring body hugging, Tiger-red colored shirts and pleated black pants for golfers. (Nike even had a rule no other golfer could wear Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s colors on game day.) No matter how you feel about Woods, the Tiger Effect is real. But not everyone has relished Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rise. Beneath all the accolades and big money, there have always been grumblings, mostly from old-school golfers and fans who resented all the changes and fanfare. Many felt the felt the power game pushed out skilled golfers with less strength. In addition, Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 prominence put the spotlight on a sport that was found lacking \u201a\u00c4\u00ec especially when it came to diversity and the systemic racism and sexism in the game at every level. Thankfully, The Tiger Effect has helped to knock down many of those barriers. But there is still much room for improvement. Watching Woods now, it is bittersweet for fans like me to acknowledge that some of his greatest contributions to the game \u201a\u00c4\u00ec power and athleticism \u201a\u00c4\u00ec now make it nearly impossible for him to dominate as once did. Sign up for CNN Opinion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Because of Tiger, today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s game is about power and distance. It rewards younger, stronger, athletes in top condition. And at 46 years old \u201a\u00c4\u00ecyoung by any measure except in professional sports \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it is unreasonable to expect Woods to intimidate and dominate. His legacy has brought other formidable power players into the game, like 23-year-old Joaquin Niemann from Chile. And now it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Niemann and younger players like him who are smashing balls and winning championships. One day, hopefully no time soon, Tiger will walk away, leaving the game of golf far better than it was when he found it. And until then, golf will continue to ride the Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wave. In the end, Tiger Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 legacy will be bigger than green jackets and golf trophies. For me it will be a story of resilience, dedication and the courage to fight for your dreams.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations have ended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined products with effect from 5 December. An oil price cap approved by Western allies in December also aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (\u00a348) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it would cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. \"Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (\u00a340) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere.\" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (\u00a3140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021, more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports went to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producers cut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022, according to EU figures. In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states are increasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, \"there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe\", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. \"This will be a problem for Germany, particularly.\" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

Sherri Papini vanished in November 2016, launching a massive search, only for the Northern California mother of two to turn up three weeks later, telling investigators she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d been kidnapped, beaten and branded. California woman accused of hoax kidnapping was driven by 'narcissistic behavior,' sheriff says The Justice Department says Papini made the whole thing up. She was arrested last Thursday and has been charged with making false statements to a law enforcement officer and mail fraud, the department said in a news release. Papini, who had been detained since her arrest, appeared before a judge via Zoom on Tuesday. US Magistrate Judge Jeremy Peterson ruled she could be released on an $120,000 bond, with certain conditions, including that her travel be limited to only one part of California, that she must receive psychiatric treatment, must surrender her passport and cannot use firearms, among other terms. The judge addressed Papini directly, warning her that if she violated those conditions, there would be further penalties. Assistant US Attorney Veronica Alegria argued against Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s release, claiming Papini is an \u201a\u00c4\u00faextreme flight risk\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and has a \u201a\u00c4\u00falengthy pattern of dishonesty.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s alleged fraudulent disappearance was not without consequences to others: It cost upward of $230,000 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facountless hours\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of manpower, according to officials. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUltimately, the investigation revealed that there was no kidnapping,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 US Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said in the DOJ news release, \u201a\u00c4\u00faand that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted based on the defendant\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conduct.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out multiples times to Michael Borges, an attorney for Papini, for comment. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s virtual court appearance, Borges said his client has no intention to flee while she awaits trial. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s husband reported her missing November 2, 2016, after she failed to pick up her kids at day care. She was found three weeks later, alone on Interstate 5 about 140 miles from home. She told police she had been kidnapped by two women who wore masks and spoke Spanish. They held her at gunpoint, she said, kept her chained in a closet and branded her. But last week, the Justice Department said Papini was actually with an ex-boyfriend in Southern California and that she caused her own injuries in support of her abduction claim. In all, the cost of the investigation borne by public safety agencies was around $150,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a conservative estimate, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said in a statement on Facebook last week. But the cost isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t only measured in dollars, Johnson said. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case and her story diverted resources from real cases with real victims. Years ago, she told police she had been abducted, beaten and branded. Now she's charged with making it all up \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the sheriff said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faFinally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faall of law enforcement in Shasta (County) was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling (of) this case.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case cost the public in other ways, too. According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, between 2017 and 2021, Papini received $30,000 from the California Victim Compensation Board, which assists and reimburses victims of violent crimes for \u201a\u00c4\u00facrime-related expenses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 they suffer. In Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case, the affidavit says, $1,000 was used so Papini could buy blinds for her home and nearly $2,000 were paid to the ambulance provider who transported Papini after she was found. The rest of the money were payments for Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s therapy and treatment for anxiety and post-traumatic stress stemming from her supposed kidnapping. Then, there was the GoFundMe campaign that allegedly netted just over $49,000. Per the affidavit, donors were told the funds would be used to \u201a\u00c4\u00fafind and bring Sherri home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In fact, federal prosecutors say, more than $30,000 was withdrawn by a family member from the campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bank account and more than $11,000 was used to pay off the family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s personal credit cards. The remaining amount was \u201a\u00c4\u00faspent on personal expenses,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the affidavit says. A GoFundMe spokesperson told CNN the fundraiser has been removed from the platform and has not been actively receiving donations since 2016. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with law enforcement to assist with their ongoing investigation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the spokesperson said. Regarding the GoFundMe campaign, family spokesman Chris Thomas referred questions to Borges, the attorney for Papini. Last week, Thomas criticized Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s arrest, which the spokesperson said happened in front of her children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf requested, Sherri would have fully complied and come to the police station,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faas she has done multiple times before, where this could have been handled in a more appropriate way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini and her husband \u201a\u00c4\u00facooperated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with law enforcement, Thomas said, adding, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are confused by several aspects of the charges and hope to get clarification in the coming days.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Taylor Romine contributed to this report.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Well, none of it was true.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, killing hundreds of people and forcing millions of others to flee the country. As of Sunday, there were more than 3 million refugees, including at least 1.5 million children, according to the International Organization for Migration. Most of them have fled to nearby countries, including Romania, Moldova, and Poland. Millions more are internally displaced within Ukraine.

Joey and Paula Reed, the parents of former US Marine Trevor Reed, stood for hours in the cold weather in Fort Worth, holding a sign about their son and waiting for Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s motorcade to pass by in the hopes that President would stop to speak with them. The Reed family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attempt to set up a meeting with Biden ahead of the visit was declined, they said. Reed\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family stood near the road waving as Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s motorcade passed by before the President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s speech. Paula Reed, Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s mother, said she saw Biden acknowledge her from his vehicle. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat was the whole purpose of coming out here, to get his attention,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, saying it was \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 worth it. A White House official said Biden called the Reeds \u201a\u00c4\u00fato reiterate his commitment to doing everything he can to bring their son home, to staying in close touch with them through his national security team and to finding a time to meet in person.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 After the speech, reporters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including a CNN producer \u201a\u00c4\u00ec at the scene with the Reed family could hear the President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voice on the cell phone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s speaker when he called. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t imagine what you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going through,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden could be heard saying during the call. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want you to think that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not something I constantly think about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds grew emotional and stepped away from reporters for the remainder of the conversation with the President, but Paula Reed shared with reporters details of the call after it had ended. She said Biden told them he felt terrible he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with them while he was in Texas and promised his scheduler would make an appointment for the family to meet with him in Washington. Biden told them he said a rosary for Trevor on his way to Texas, according to Paula Reed. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe was just very, very apologetic that he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.

And he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to stop.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki had told reporters that a meeting could still happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00fa(W)e are working toward setting up a meeting with his family. The President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking forward to doing that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Psaki told reporters en route to Fort Worth aboard Air Force One. Trevor Reed has been detained in Russia since 2019. He was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the \u201a\u00c4\u00falife and health\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of Russian police officers after a night of drinking. He and his family have denied the charges and US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan called the trial \u201a\u00c4\u00fatheater of the absurd.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerned the invasion of Ukraine will worsen his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fate, along with that of Paul Whelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. The Reed family, who met with Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan last December, has said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been asking for the meeting with the President for months. Shortly after Psaki said a presidential meeting was in the works, Joey Reed told CNN the family has not had any new communication with the White House. Jon Franks, a spokesman for the Reed family, said Psaki\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statements were very welcome. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are grateful they seem to have reconsidered and await details. Just a reminder that the Reeds gratefully acknowledged their meeting with NSA Sullivan when it took place back in December. They look forward to gratefully acknowledging a meeting with their President,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Franks said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe want to talk to the President and say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the only man in the world who can bring him home and you can do it today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said Tuesday before the White House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Joey Reed said he heard Monday that the meeting during Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s trip on Tuesday would not happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we were told second hand was that there wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI know that every second is planned out for the President every day, but three minutes? Three or four minutes? I think he could spare that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trevor Reed has said in recent weeks that he is coughing up blood, and his family is concerned he has tuberculosis. Joey Reed said he spoke with his son as recently as Monday and asked Trevor if he wanted to pass along a message to Biden. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have anything to say to the President. I think that they have forgotten about me,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have not (forgotten about him). We love our son and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to fight to our dying day to bring him home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Brianna Keilar on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wednesday that they spoke with Trevor again Wednesday morning. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe called us again this morning. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been sounding horrible, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coughing constantly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd then we had even worse news this morning, he called and could barely talk. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s had some sort of accident and he believes he might have broken a rib.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed also said Trevor told them he would be sent to a hospital prison on Friday to be checked and while he believed Trevor has been honest about his health, expressed uncertainty that his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s injury was an accident. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt just seems to be getting worse and worse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Whelan, a former United States Marine, was sentenced to 16 years in prison on an espionage charge he vehemently denies. Whelan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family has said in recent days that the US should not forget about him and Reed as the US discusses Russian sanctions. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are watching the impact of sanctions, expected retaliation by the Russian Federation government, and making what contingency plans we can to support him,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Paul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s brother, David Whelan wrote in a statement released late last week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPaul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wrongful detention has always been about the Russian Federation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government extracting concessions from the US government.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the Russian Federation demands the concession of sanction removal, let Paul and Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s freedom be part of the price the Russian authorities pay in return,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 David Whelan added in the statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur family will be expressing this view to members of Congress, the State Department, and the White House.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. This week, the White House has turned some of its focus to Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention of American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner has been detained in Russia after customs officials detected cannabis oil in the athlete\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s luggage at an airport near Moscow, according to the Russian Federal Customs Service. According to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the administration is working on the process to get her out of Russia. The White House, so far, has publicly declined to discuss Griner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention or their potential efforts to secure her release.

The discovery of a wild-born Eastern indigo snake marks the success of an intensive program to reintroduce the reptiles to the state. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe snake found yesterday indicates the project is resulting in some thriving and reproducing indigos, just what we wanted!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division said Thursday on Facebook. \u201a\u00c4\u00faReintroducing a species to its native range is a daunting task, and we celebrate each step of its success!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The reptile, which is the largest snake native to the US, used to be found throughout Alabama. But they went extinct in the state in the 1950s, largely due to habitat loss, according to the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The snakes, however, are a crucial element of the ecosystem. Jim Godwin, an animal biologist with the Alabama Natural Heritage Program administered by the Auburn University Museum of Natural History, told CNN that Eastern indigo snakes were historically the \u201a\u00c4\u00faapex predator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the longleaf pine forests where they live. A decline in the snake\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s population, therefore, has a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadomino effect\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on other species in the ecosystem. So in 2006, a team of Alabama conservationists launched a project to reintroduce the Eastern indigo snake to the state. Starting with wild-captured individuals from Georgia, where the snakes are also found, they began to breed a captive population. In 2010, the first snakes from the captive population were released into Conecuh National Forest. The goal is to eventually introduce a total of 300 snakes to create a healthy and viable population in Alabama. The discovery of wild-born Eastern indigo snakes means the released snakes survived and had offspring, providing a glimpse of hope for the species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 success in Alabama. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is an excellent indicator that the snakes that we have released, which were born into captivity, have been able to adapt to the wild, are functioning as wild snakes, and are reproducing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Godwin. The snake discovered was clearly wild-born due to two factors, according to Godwin: its small size and its lack of a PIT (or passive integrated transponder) tag. The hatchling was clearly smaller than those released from captivity, which were usually at least two feet long; the snakes can grow up to eight feet long in adulthood. And the released snakes are tagged with PIT tags, which have small microchips allowing researchers to identify each animal by its unique code. The first wild-born Eastern indigo snake was discovered in Alabama in 2020, according to the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Both snakes were actually found by accident, according to Godwin, who explained \u201a\u00c4\u00fait\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s difficult to just go out and do a search for them, because they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re small, and they can hide very easily.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 During the winter, the project team monitors the burrows of gopher tortoises, where the adult Eastern indigo snakes breed in the colder months, in hopes of identifying the animals. The reintroduction project has been an ongoing collaboration between Auburn University, the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the US Forest Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and other partners, Godwin said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

The regulation on so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00faghost guns\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec unregulated, untraceable weapons made from kits \u201a\u00c4\u00ec would address a critical gap in the government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to track them. Growing ghost gun problem adds to America's violence woes Biden is also expected to name Steve Dettelbach, a former US attorney from Ohio, as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as soon as Monday, according to a US official. Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s previous nominee was forced to withdraw amid opposition in the Senate. The moves come as gun violence and crime have ticked up in the United States, putting pressure on the White House to take action. Biden was expected to address new steps on guns in a public event Monday afternoon, according to people who have received invitations. The White House declined to comment on the new steps, which were described by three people familiar with the matter not authorized to speak publicly. Dettelbach did not respond to a request for comment. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer again decried the use of ghost guns during a press conference Sunday, calling for a crackdown on the rise of the privately made firearms and speaking about a deadly shooting in the Bronx Friday. The New York Democrat on Sunday blamed Republicans for holding up gun reform legislation, while pressing Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration to go further. \u201a\u00c4\u00faToday I am calling on the administration to go all after ghost guns, by putting out regulations that will stop them. The federal government has the ability through regulation to stop these ghost guns,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Following a 2021 directive from the Biden administration, the ATF proposed a rule in May last year to allow the bureau to classify the building blocks that often make up ghost guns as firearms. The rule has been winding its way through the federal regulation process since then. The ATF rule addresses a key problem in tracking and regulating ghost guns because certain frames and receivers used to assemble the guns are often purchased online and not classified as firearms by the bureau. The rule would also require manufactures who sell parts to assemble ghost guns to be licensed and to run background checks on potential purchasers of the kits used to assemble the products. The Justice Department has also launched a national ghost gun enforcement initiative, which will \u201a\u00c4\u00fatrain a national cadre of prosecutors and disseminate investigation and prosecution tools to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the White House. Ghost guns have been used in multiple recent shootings, including at a Maryland high school in January. The exact number in circulation is unknowable, given the inability of regulators to track them. Multiple states have moved to restrict their sale as ghost guns become more common at crime scenes. Last week, Maryland joined Washington, DC, and 10 other states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in banning or restricting the purchase or use of ghost guns, which are often bought online and assembled at home. In September, Biden withdrew his nomination of David Chipman to lead the ATF after facing opposition from Republicans and certain moderate Democrats. ATF nominee failed to disclose talks and events to Senate committee, including speaking on politics of agents Chipman, a former career official at ATF, came under scrutiny from pro-gun rights supporters and the National Rifle Association for his work as a senior adviser to Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the organization started by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at an event in her Arizona district in 201 Dettelbach ran unsuccessfully for Ohio attorney general in 2018 after serving as US attorney in the state.

Sheena Greitens, who now resides in Texas with the former couple\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s two children, said she grew so afraid of her former husband that she sought to limit his access to weapons and began sleeping in her children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s room out of concern for their safety, according to an affidavit filed in the Circuit Court of Boone County in Missouri, as part of her effort to have a custody case moved to Texas. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn early June 2018, I became afraid for my safety and that of our children at our home, which was fairly isolated, due to Eric\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unstable and coercive behavior,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, according to court records from the ongoing custody battle. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis behavior included physical violence toward our children, such as cuffing our then three-year-old son across the face at the dinner table in front of me and yanking him around by his hair.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sheena Greitens said she and others were so concerned about Eric Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 behavior that they limited his access to firearms on three occasions. She said she was concerned about the \u201a\u00c4\u00faescalation of physical violence\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and eventually, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI started sleeping in my children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s room simply to try to keep them safe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to her affidavit. In a statement, Eric Greitens denied the allegations. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBeing a father is the joy of my life and my single most important responsibility,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI will continue to love and care for my beautiful sons with all of my being, and that includes fighting for the truth and against completely fabricated, baseless allegations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, his attorney asked the judge to seal the custody case. In her affidavit, Sheena Greitens laid out a series of allegations of verbal threats and physical abuse against both her and their children. She detailed how Eric Greitens allegedly threatened to use his political ties to tarnish his ex-wife\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reputation. In one instance, she claimed Eric Greitens had \u201a\u00c4\u00faknocked me down and confiscated my cell phone, wallet, and keys so that I was unable to call for help or extricate myself and our children,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the court filing. In another 2019 incident, one of the children returned from a visit with Eric Greitens with a swollen face, bleeding gums and a loose tooth, according to her court filing. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said Dad had hit him; however, Eric said they were roughhousing and it had been an accident,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sheena Greitens said in her affidavit. At one point, Sheena Greitens said she tried to flee with the children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen I told Eric about my plans, he threatened to come to the airport and have me arrested for kidnapping and child abuse, saying that because of his authority as a former Governor who had supported law enforcement, the police would support him and not believe me, and I would lose our children,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the affidavit. Sheena and Eric Greitens divorced in 2020. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 campaign manager Dylan Johnson said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHis ex-wife is engaged in a last-ditch attempt to vindictively destroy her ex-husband. Though she knows that the press will viciously repeat her false allegations, Eric has always been a great Dad, who loves his boys and has always put them first, and that is why he is filing for full custody of his children.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In a Tuesday statement, Sheena Greitens stood by her sworn affidavit and said she would provide evidence and documentation if the court requests it. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMy only interest is what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best for my two children, and for the last four years, I have gone to great lengths to keep these family matters private to protect them,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in her statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI am not interested in litigating this matter anywhere other than the courtroom.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Eric Greitens has been vying for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Roy Blunt. The crowded primary also includes US Rep. Vicky Hartzler, State Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long and others. In the wake of the latest allegations, Hartzler, Schmitt and Long called on Greitens to drop out of the race. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have one thing that I want to say: real men never abuse women and children. Period. End of story,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hartzler said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time for Eric to get out of the Senate race and to get professional help.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Schmitt called the abuse allegations \u201a\u00c4\u00fasickening,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe behavior described in this affidavit is cause for Eric Greitens to be in prison, not on the ballot for U.S. Senate. He should end his campaign immediately.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Long said he was \u201a\u00c4\u00fashocked and appalled\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by what was in the affidavit, adding of Greitens: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe is clearly unfit to represent the state of Missouri in the United States Senate. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no way he can stay in this race.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, on Monday became the highest-ranking Republican to say Greitens should leave the race. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who called on Greitens to resign as governor in 2018 and has endorsed Hartzler in the Senate primary, also called for him to drop out, expressing concern that Republicans could lose the seat if Greitens were the nominee. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had no comment on Greitens on Monday. Walking in silence without saying anything, the Kentucky Republican would not respond to questions about whether the Senate candidate should drop out. On Tuesday, Blunt \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the senator Greitens is vying to replace \u201a\u00c4\u00ec also said Greitens should step aside if the allegations against him are true. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the statements filed with the court are true, he should not be a candidate for the Senate,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blunt told CNN. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 stunning fall from grace in 2018 came as he faced calls for impeachment from the GOP-controlled state legislature and a criminal charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec invasion of privacy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec related to a 2015 affair, in which his former hairdresser alleged he tied her up, coerced her into oral sex and threatened to blackmail her with partially nude photos to cover up their affair. Greitens admitted to the affair but refuted the blackmail claim. He was separately charged with another felony \u201a\u00c4\u00ec tampering with computer data \u201a\u00c4\u00ec for allegedly misusing a veterans charity\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s donor list for his 2016 gubernatorial campaign. The criminal charges against Greitens were dropped. And a former FBI agent investigating the blackmail allegations was later indicted for perjury and tampering with physical evidence. When a Missouri ethics panel investigated Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 campaign misconduct, it found no evidence of wrongdoing but fined the campaign for failing to report in-kind contributions. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 accuser never recanted her sexual misconduct allegations. Sheena Greitens said in her affidavit filed Monday that Eric Greitens admitted to her that he took the photo that resulted in the invasion of privacy charge, but \u201a\u00c4\u00fahe threatened that I would be exposed to legal jeopardy if I ever disclosed that fact to anyone.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She also alleged that in the spring and summer of 2018, \u201a\u00c4\u00faEric repeatedly threatened to kill himself unless I provided specific public support to him.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Earlier this year, the former governor told CNN that he did \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 nothing wrong with his former hairdresser and claimed that he resigned for his two children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt was the thing that I had to do for the people who I love the most, particularly for my boys, given those tremendous lies and the tremendous pressure that was on my kids,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. But Sheena Greitens pushed back on that explanation in her court filing, saying their young children were \u201a\u00c4\u00faunaware of the scandal, and I would like them to remain so until they are older.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have privately entreated Eric to stop introducing false and misleading information about our marriage and divorce into the public in his quest for political office,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to her court filing. Before the scandals, Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, was a rising star in the Republican Party. In the Senate race, he has completely aligned himself with former President Donald Trump. He has spread the lie that Trump won the 2020 presidential election, said he would not support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for Senate GOP leader and recently visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Florida resort, where he met with Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who advises his Senate campaign.

The 15-time major winner stunned the golfing world earlier this week when he announced that he would be making a dramatic return to the sport after suffering serious leg injuries in a car crash in February 2021. After shocking many by making the cut on Friday with some determined play, his injuries and lack of match fitness seemed to catch up with him over the weekend. He carded a six-over par 78 on Saturday, his worst score in a Masters round, and finished with the same score on Sunday to finish on 13-over. While he might be well down on the leaderboard, overall it was a successful four days for the five-time Masters winner who showcased the spirit that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s made him so successful in his first competitive golf action in almost a year and a half. Afterwards, Woods confirmed he will play at the 150th Open Championship at St. Andrews, Scotland in July. Woods said he was still undecided about playing in golf\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s next major, the PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in May. When he was asked if he thinks this week was one of the greatest achievements of his career, Woods said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faFor not winning an event, yes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faTo go from where I was to get to this point, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve had an incredible team that has helped me get to this point and incredible support from \u201a\u00c4\u00ec as I alluded to in the press conference on Tuesday, the amount of texts and FaceTimes and calls I got from players that are close to me throughout this entire time has meant a lot,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Woods explained. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThen to come here on these grounds and have the patrons \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I played in a Covid year, and then I didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t play last year. 2019 was the last time for me that I experienced having the patrons like this, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s exciting. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inspiring. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fun to hear the roars, to hear the hole-in-ones. I think Kitchen made one the other day. To hear that roar down there at the bottom on 16, just to hear that excitement of what this tournament brings out. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have just an amazing day today with now the wind is starting to pick up, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s starting to swirl a little bit. I think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to get tight, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be fun to watch.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wherever Woods went over the Augusta course, the crowds that followed him were rows and rows deep. His featuring at the major that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s won five times was a huge draw for many, with fans everywhere wishing the best for him as he made his highly-anticipated return. And those fans got what they wanted over the first two round, with some glimpses of his class shinning through as he made an unexpected cut. But in tricky weather conditions on Saturday, Woods struggled as it appeared the hilly Augusta National began to take a toll on his body. His recovery after the car crash included surgery to place a rod and pins in his right leg, and excruciating physical rehabilitation. His round was littered with bogeys and birdies, as well as two double-bogeys \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a rare occurrence for Woods at the Masters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec as he slipped down the leaderboard. On Sunday, playing alongside Jon Rahm under the bright Georgia sun, Woods was the center of attention during the early pairings to go out, receiving huge cheers from the patrons as he made his way around the course. Wearing his famous red and black clothing \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the colors he traditionally wears on the final day of majors \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Woods delighted fans with some delicate touches and trademark excellence, including a monster putt on the 14th hole to salvage a bogey. Overall, he carded one birdie, five bogeys and a double bogey during his final round to finish 13-over par \u201a\u00c4\u00ec but walked off the 18th hole to a standing ovation and cheers from spectators. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos While he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t trouble the top of the leaderboard, Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 appearance at the Masters was about more than what happened on the course.

It is often tempting to look upon Vladimir Putin as the millennium bug in a human and deadly form. The Russian president rose to power on 31 December 1999, as the world held its breath that computers would go into meltdown when the clock struck midnight, unable to process the change from 1999 to 2000. In the 20 years since, Putin has been trying to engineer a different kind of global system malfunction, the destruction of the liberal international order. The former KGB spymaster wanted to turn back the clock: to revive Russia's tsarist greatness and to restore the might and menace of the Soviet Union prior to its break-up in 1991. This Russian revanchist has become the most disruptive international leader of the 21st Century, the mastermind behind so much misery from Chechnya to Crimea, from Syria to the cathedral city of Salisbury. He has sought - successfully at times - to redraw the map of Europe. He has tried - successfully at times - to immobilise the United Nations. He has been determined - successfully at times - to weaken America, and hasten its division and decline. Putin came to power at a moment of western hubris. The United States was the sole superpower in a unipolar world. Francis Fukuyama's End of History thesis, proclaiming the triumph of liberal democracy, was widely accepted. Some economists even peddled the theory that recessions would be no more, partly because of the productivity gains of the new digital economy. It was also thought that globalisation, and the interdependence it wrought, would stop major economic powers fighting wars. The same utopianism attached itself to the internet, which was seen overwhelmingly as a force for global good. In the early days especially, the same misplaced optimism and wishful thinking coloured the west's approach to Putin - a figure, it is now obvious, who was trying to buck history and thwart democratisation, however many lives were lost in the process. Successive US presidents have played into his hands. Bill Clinton, the occupant of the White House when Putin came to power, handed this ultra-nationalist a popular grievance by pushing for the expansion of Nato right up to Russia's borders. As George F Kennan, the famed architect of America's Cold War strategy of containment, warned at the time: \"Expanding Nato would be the most fateful error of America policy in the entire post-Cold War era.\" George W Bush completely misjudged his Russian counterpart. \"I looked the man in the eye,\" Bush famously said after their first meeting in Slovenia in 2001. \"I found him very straightforward and trustworthy\u2026 I was able to get a sense of his soul.\" Bush mistakenly thought he could mount a charm offensive with Putin, and gently cajole him further down the democratic path. But even though Bush visited Russia more than any other country - including, as a personal favour, two trips in 2002 to Putin's home city, St Petersburg - the Russian leader was already displaying dangerously despotic tendencies. In 2008, Bush's final year as president, Putin invaded Georgia - what he called a \"peace enforcement operation\". The Kremlin argued then - and has continued to argue ever since - that it was hypocritical for Washington to complain about this violation of international law after Bush had invaded Iraq. Barack Obama sought to reframe US-Russian relations. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, even handed her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov a mock reset button (which was mistakenly labelled with the Russian word for \"overloaded\"). But Putin knew that America, after its long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, no longer wanted to police the world. When Obama refused in 2013 to enforce his red-line warning against Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator used chemical weapons against his own people, Putin saw a green light. By helping Assad carry out his murderous war, he extended Moscow's sphere of influence in the Middle East when the United States wanted to extract itself from the region. The following year, he annexed Crimea, and established a foothold in eastern Ukraine. Despite being told by Obama to \"cut it out,\" Putin even sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the hope that Hillary Clinton, a long-time nemesis, would be defeated and that Donald Trump, a long-time fan boy, would win. The New York property tycoon made no secret of his admiration for Putin, a sycophantic approach that seems to have further emboldened the Russian president. Much to Moscow's delight, Trump publicly criticised Nato, weakened the US post-war alliance system and became such a polarising figure that he left America more politically divided than at any time since the Civil War. Arguably, then, you have to reach back 30 years to find a US leader whose approach to the Kremlin has stood the test of time. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, George Herbert Walker Bush resisted the temptation to rejoice in America's Cold War victory - much to the astonishment of the White House press pack, he refused to travel to Berlin for a victory lap - knowing that it would bolster hardliners in the Politburo and military seeking to oust Mikhail Gorbachev. That magnanimity in victory helped when it came to bringing about the reunification of Germany, which was arguably Bush's greatest foreign policy success. Putin is obviously a more formidable adversary, harder to deal with than even Leonid Brezhnev or Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet premier during the Cuban Missile Crisis. But since the turn of the century no US president has truly had his measure. Joe Biden, like George Herbert Walker Bush, is a Cold War warrior, who has dedicated his presidency to defending democracy at home and abroad. Seeking to re-establish America's traditional post-war role as the leader of the free world, he has sought to mobilise the international community, offered military aid to Ukraine and adopted the toughest sanction regime ever targeted against Putin. As Russian forces amassed at the border, he also shared US intelligence showing that Putin had decided to invade, in ways that sought to disrupt the Kremlin's usual misinformation campaigns and false flag operations. His State of the Union address became a rallying cry. \"Freedom will always triumph over tyranny,\" he said. And while Biden does not speak with the clarity or force of a Kennedy or a Reagan, it was nonetheless a significant speech. What's been striking since the Russian invasion started, however, has been the assertion of forceful presidential leadership from elsewhere. Volodymyr Zelensky has been lauded and lionised, as he has continued this extraordinary personal journey from comedian to Churchillian colossus. In Brussels, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has been another commanding presence. This former German politician has been a driving force behind the decision, for the first time in EU history, to finance and purchase weapons for a nation under attack, a commitment that includes not just ammunition but fighter jets as well. Her compatriot, the new Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, has also shown more resolve in dealing with Putin than his predecessor Angela Merkel. At warp speed, he has overturned decades of post-Cold War German foreign policy, an approach so often predicated on caution and timidity towards the Russian leader. Berlin has sent anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine (ending the policy of not sending weapons to active war zones), halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, withdrawn its opposition to blocking Russia from the SWIFT international payments system, and even committed to spending 2% of its GDP on defence spending. The biggest assault on a European state since World War Two has stiffened European resolve. But so, too, it seems has the relative weakness of America. Mindful of the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan and possibility of a Trump 2.0 presidency, European leaders seem to have realised that they can no longer lean so heavily on Washington to defend democracy in this hour of maximum peril. Leadership of the free world has, in this crisis, become a common endeavour. Even since the end of the Cold War, Washington has been calling upon European nations to do more to police its own neighbourhood, something they failed to do when the break-up of the former Yugoslavia sparked the Bosnian war. Historians may well conclude that it took a combination of Putin's aggressiveness, America's fragility, Ukraine's heroic resolve and the fear that Europe's post-war stability is truly on the line to finally make that happen. This video can not be played Watch: What Americans think of Biden's Ukraine response It would be naive to be swept away by the romanticism of Zelensky's speeches or to succumb to the dopamine high of watching the seizure of Russian-owned super-yachts unfold on social media. Putin is intensifying the war. But the last week has sent a message to Moscow - and to Beijing as well - that the post-war international order still continues to function, despite the deployment of the Russian war machine to bring about its collapse. Just as history never ended, nor has liberal democracy. As Joe Biden put it in his State of the Union, during a passage in which rhetoric served also as sober analysis: Putin \"thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met a wall of resistance he never imagined\". Nick Bryant is the author of When America Stopped Being Great: a history of the present.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A New York State judge died by suicide Tuesday weeks after federal agents searched his home. John L. Michalski, an acting justice of the state Supreme Court, was found dead at his home in Amherst, New York, a suburb outside of Buffalo, Tuesday before noon, his lawyer, Terrence Connors, confirmed to The New York Times. Connors said the 61-year-old died by suicide, describing his loss as a \"tragedy,\" adding that \"it would be difficult to find a justice who was more respected\" than Michalski. NOTORIOUS NY MOB HIT MAN WHO KILLED 2 ESCAPES FEDERAL CUSTODY IN FLORIDA Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the court system, told the Times that Amherst police advised officials about Michalski\u2019s death but declined to provide more details, referring questions to law enforcement. According to his official bio on the state court website, Michalski was named to the Court of Claims in 2006 and as an acting state Supreme Court justice later that year. (Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images) Citing two government sources, The Buffalo News reported that law enforcement executed a search warrant on Michalski\u2019s home last month in connection to a federal investigation into the judge and his wife over potential tax crimes related to an online retail clothing and jewelry business operated out of the residence. Neither Michalski nor his wife had been charged in connection to the probe. Federal authorities had also continued to investigate Michalski over his close friendship with Peter Gerace Jr., the owner of Pharaoh\u2019s Gentlemen\u2019s Club in Cheektowaga, outside of Buffalo. The Miami Herald previously described Gerace as the nephew of reputed Buffalo mob boss Joseph A. Todaro Jr. Peter Gerace Jr. was arrested last year in southern Florida on federal conspiracy to commit sex tracking, bribery and drug distribution charges. (Broward Sheriff's Office) Michalski reportedly attempted suicide once before in February 2021 by lying on train tracks at an Amtrak station in the Buffalo suburb of Depew. A freight train passed over him, causing serious leg injuries. He took a leave of absence from the $210,900-a-year seat on the bench but resumed work in January of this year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The judge first tried to kill himself on the same day Gerace was arrested in Florida on federal conspiracy to commit sex tracking, bribery and drug distribution charges. The federal superseding indictment did not name Michalski, but it did accuse a federal DEA agent named Joseph Bongiovanni of using his position to shield friends and associates, including Gerace, from criminal investigations in the Buffalo-area. Gerace has since been transferred back to the Western District of New York.

The five-figure penalties on the two flyers accused of violence are part of $2m (\u00a31.5m) in fines levied this year. US airlines have seen record numbers of disruptive passengers since early 2021, with many incidents involving the refusal to wear an anti-viral facemask. The fines were announced by transport secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday. \"If you are on an airplane, don't be a jerk and don't endanger the flight crews and fellow passengers,\" he said in an appearance on ABC's The View. \"If you do, you will be fined by the FAA.\" In one incident, an American Airlines passenger travelling from Texas to North Carolina has been asked to pay a $81,950 fine for threatening to hurt a flight attendant. The attendant had offered to help the passenger after she fell into the aisle of the plane. The unnamed passenger then allegedly pushed an airline worker and tried to open the cabin door. While flight attendants attempted to restrain her, she repeatedly hit one staff member in the head. When she was placed in cuffs, \"she spit at, headbutted, bit and tried to kick the crew and other passengers\", the FAA said in a news release. In the other incident, the passenger was flying on Delta Air Lines from Las Vegas to Atlanta. She allegedly tried to \"hug and kiss the passenger seated next to her, walked to the front of the aircraft to try to exit during flight; refused to return to her seat; and bit another passenger multiple times\". That passenger, who is also unnamed, was physically restrained by crew members and has now been asked to pay a fine of $77,272. Neither incident involved a failure to adhere to Covid measures. In his interview with The View, Mr Buttigieg said the US would decide by 18 April on whether to extend the federal requirement to wear masks on planes and in airports. The FAA announced a \"zero-tolerance\" policy on unruly passengers in January 2021, and has issued some $7m in fines since then. They have recorded 7,060 air rage incidents and say around 70% involved masking rules. But the rate of incidents has now declined by 60% since its high last year.

The agency said this amounted to a \u201a\u00c4\u00faselective default\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because investors are unlikely to be able to convert the rubles into \u201a\u00c4\u00fadollars equivalent to the originally due amounts.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 According to S&P, a selective default is declared when an entity has defaulted on a specific obligation but not its entire debt. Moscow has a grace period of 30 days from April 4 to make the payments of capital and interest, but S&P said it does not expect it will convert them into dollars given Western sanctions that undermine its \u201a\u00c4\u00fawillingness and technical abilities to honor the terms and conditions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of its obligations. A full foreign currency default would be Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first in more than a century, when Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated bonds issued by the Tsarist government. Russia cannot access roughly $315 billion of its foreign currency reserves as a result of Western sanctions imposed following its invasion of Ukraine. Until last week, the United States allowed Russia to use some of its frozen assets to pay back certain investors in dollars. But the US Treasury has since blocked the country from accessing its reserves at American banks, part of its effort to ramp up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and further diminish his war chest. JPMorgan estimates that Russia had about $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of last year, with about half of that held by foreign investors. Russia is now planning legal action. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will sue, because we undertook all necessary action so that investors would receive their payments,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will show the court proof of our payments, to confirm our efforts to pay in rubles, just as we did in foreign currency. It won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be a simple process,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. He did not say who Russia planned to sue. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a press conference last week that any default would be \u201a\u00c4\u00faartificial\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because Russia has the dollars to pay \u201a\u00c4\u00ee it just can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t access them. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are no grounds for a real default,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Peskov said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot even close.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Russia has gone to great lengths to artificially prop up the ruble \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which sank by as much as 40% to less than one US cent in the days after the invasion \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including by hiking interest rates to 20%, and by forcing exporters to swap most of their foreign currency revenues for rubles. That measure is still in place but the central bank has decided to relax some other restrictions, Reuters reported Monday, and last week announced that it was cutting interest rates to 17%. The ruble was trading at 79 to the US dollar on Monday, according to data from Refinitiv. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s about 5% weaker than on Saturday. \u201a\u00c4\u00ee David Goldman and Chris Liakos contributed reporting.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

It even has control of time itself - or, at least, over the time that is displayed on the nation's clocks. Since World War One, the US - like many nations around the world - has set its clocks forward during summer hours in order to have more daylight in the afternoon (and, theoretically, conserve electricity), then rolled them back in autumn. On Tuesday, the US Senate voted to do away with that switch, making Daylight Savings Time - the summer month clock settings - permanent year-round. The legislation, called the Sunshine Protection Act, is the pet project of Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida (whose nickname, perhaps not coincidentally, is \"the Sunshine State\"). He has been pitching legislation to make Daylight Savings Time permanent for four years, but this is the first time he's found some success. The Senate measure was approved by unanimous consent - a process usually reserved for non-controversial legislation like naming post offices, designating disease-awareness days and celebrating sports league champions - just a few days after the US implemented its annual \"spring forward\" time change. \"Pardon the pun,\" Mr Rubio said after the bill was approved, \"but this is an idea whose time has come.\" During his floor speech, the Florida senator presented a number of arguments in favour of the change. He said there are studies showing that clock-switching has a deleterious effect on health. Heart attacks and accident rates increase around the time changes. And anything that gives children more daylight to play in after school ends, instead of sitting inside, in front of electronics, is a good thing in his mind. (Florida is a state where children might still want to play outside in January, of course.) Education is a concern for opponents of the legislation, however, who note that more children will end up going to school in the dark - which could be dangerous - under the new system. Any one senator could have objected and prevented passage of Mr Rubio's proposal, but the speed at which it came up for consideration may have caught opponents off-guard. According to Buzzfeed News, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton would have blocked the bill but his staff didn't inform him the legislation was being brought to the floor. Confusion seemed to be the order of the day for all but a handful of the Senate's daylight time enthusiasts. \"It's literally an issue my staff and I had never discussed, and they made an assumption that I don't really care about daylight saving time,\" Delaware Senator Chris Coons told Buzzfeed. \"And I don't know if I do! I've never taken five minutes to stop and think about it.\" It's too late for that now, at least in the Senate. The legislation moves to the House of Representatives, where it must also be approved by majority vote before it can be signed into law by President Joe Biden. The White House hasn't taken a position on the matter, but House Speaker Nany Pelosi, after expressing  her own surprise that the Senate had acted so quickly, said she supported the measure - although she added that her chamber was more focused on tasks related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The diplomatic spat is over a letter seeking support for a draft Russian resolution about aid in Ukraine. Canada posted the letter to Twitter with \"suggested edits\", which led to retweets from other UN missions. A Russian diplomat has called it \"Russophobic libel\". An image of the letter - annotated in red type - was posted on Canada's official UN mission Twitter account on Thursday. The letter, signed by Russian diplomat Vassily Nebenzia, had been sent to all UN members the previous day. In it, Mr Nebenzia says he is \"reaching out with regards to an urgent matter related to the dire humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine\". Canada's annotation adds to that line: \"which we have caused as a result of our illegal war of aggression\". The letter goes on to say that \"Western colleagues\" are \"politicising the humanitarian issue\". Canada adds \"Do you think the UN membership actually believes this? Please explain.\" Dmitry Polyanskiy, first deputy permanent representative of Russia to the United Nations, responded to the tweet, saying it \"shows that your diplomatic skills and good manners are at lowest ebb\" and reminding Canada that it twice failed to secure enough support to win a non-permanent seat on the powerful UN Security Council. The letter was meant to boost support for a draft resolution on providing humanitarian relief in Ukraine, which was scheduled for a vote on Friday at the UN Security Council. The resolution has been criticised by Western nations for its failure to mention Russia's responsibility for the war. That scheduled vote was cancelled by Russia on Thursday. The United States' envoy to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Russia's resolution was \"farcical\" and \"doomed to fail\", according to the AFP news agency.

In a statement, the Academy said the 94th Oscars had been \"overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behaviour we saw Mr Smith exhibit on stage\". Smith has apologised for his actions and resigned from the Academy. The actor hit Rock for joking about his wife's shaved head, a result of the hair-loss condition alopecia. Less than an hour later, he was awarded the best actor award for his role in King Richard, where he played the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards ceremony, met virtually on Friday to discuss disciplinary action. In a statement, it said banning Smith was aimed at protecting performers and guests and \"restoring trust in the Academy\". The Academy said that directly after the slap it did not \"adequately address the situation in the room\" and had been \"unprepared for the unprecedented\". It apologised for this. It also thanked Rock for \"maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances\". In his resignation statement, Smith said he had \"betrayed the trust of the Academy\" and was \"heartbroken\" over his actions. He added he would \"fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct\". Smith's resignation means he will be unable to vote for future Oscars. The Academy's disciplinary review over the incident, originally scheduled for 18 April, was fast-tracked after he resigned. Few have ever stepped down from the Academy. Four members - producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Bill Cosby, director Roman Polanski and cinematographer Adam Kimmel - have been booted over sexual misconduct allegations, while actor Carmine Caridi was expelled in 2004 for pirating screener videos given to him. But the standards of conduct laid out by the film academy contained various disciplinary options for Smith, such as excluding him from future Oscars ceremonies, revoking his eligibility for awards or taking back his newly won Oscar. Only one Oscar has ever been taken back; a feature called Young Americans won the best documentary honour in 1969 but was found to be ineligible for the award that year. Late last month, actor Whoopi Goldberg - a member of the Academy's board of governors - predicted Smith would face \"big consequences\" but said \"we're not going to take that Oscar away from him.\" Beyond the Academy's actions, at least two studios - Sony and Netflix - are pausing their projects with Smith. Rock, who began his latest stand up comedy tour shortly after the Oscars telecast, has not commented publicly on the slap.

The five-figure penalties on the two flyers accused of violence are part of $2m (\u00a31.5m) in fines levied this year. US airlines have seen record numbers of disruptive passengers since early 2021, with many incidents involving the refusal to wear an anti-viral facemask. The fines were announced by transport secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday. \"If you are on an airplane, don't be a jerk and don't endanger the flight crews and fellow passengers,\" he said in an appearance on ABC's The View. \"If you do, you will be fined by the FAA.\" In one incident, an American Airlines passenger travelling from Texas to North Carolina has been asked to pay a $81,950 fine for threatening to hurt a flight attendant. The attendant had offered to help the passenger after she fell into the aisle of the plane. The unnamed passenger then allegedly pushed an airline worker and tried to open the cabin door. While flight attendants attempted to restrain her, she repeatedly hit one staff member in the head. When she was placed in cuffs, \"she spit at, headbutted, bit and tried to kick the crew and other passengers\", the FAA said in a news release. In the other incident, the passenger was flying on Delta Air Lines from Las Vegas to Atlanta. She allegedly tried to \"hug and kiss the passenger seated next to her, walked to the front of the aircraft to try to exit during flight; refused to return to her seat; and bit another passenger multiple times\". That passenger, who is also unnamed, was physically restrained by crew members and has now been asked to pay a fine of $77,272. Neither incident involved a failure to adhere to Covid measures. In his interview with The View, Mr Buttigieg said the US would decide by 18 April on whether to extend the federal requirement to wear masks on planes and in airports. The FAA announced a \"zero-tolerance\" policy on unruly passengers in January 2021, and has issued some $7m in fines since then. They have recorded 7,060 air rage incidents and say around 70% involved masking rules. But the rate of incidents has now declined by 60% since its high last year.

Prosecutors say the men, some of whom are alleged militia members, targeted Gretchen Whitmer over Covid rules she imposed early in the pandemic. Lawyers for the accused say that the government's evidence is flimsy and have indicated an entrapment defence. The closely-watched trial is expected to last about six weeks. According to the FBI, which says it interrupted the plot 17 months ago, the men had planned to blow up a bridge near the governor's vacation home, then kidnap her and put her on a \"treason trial\". Ultimately 14 alleged plotters were arrested in late 2020. Six of the group were charged in a federal court. The other eight face separate state charges. Two of the men who faced federal charges have already pleaded guilty and are expected to testify against the remaining four at the trial. The undercover FBI agents that infiltrated the group are also expected to testify, and have been forced by a judge to reveal their real names over the objections of prosecutors. \"Making it crystal clear to the jury and the public that inside the courtroom, nothing is undercover and everything is out in the open will best ensure fairness during trial and eventual acceptance and respect for whatever the jury ultimately decides,\" Chief US District Judge Robert Jonker ruled on Thursday. Suspects Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, and Brandon Caserta, 33, are from Michigan, while Barry Croft, 46, is from the state of Delaware. All four are facing charges of kidnapping conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mr Croft and Mr Harris are also facing charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. Prosecutors say they will prove the men took specific steps towards achieving their plan, including travelling to the governor's home, testing explosives and training for combat against Gov Whitmer's security team. On Tuesday, around 100 potential jurors were indirectly asked about their personal politics, including whether they approve of Gov Whitmer and whether they view the 6 January Capitol riots as an \"insurrection\" or a \"legitimate political protest\". Rules ban lawyers from directly asking about political affiliation. The juror pool has been pulled from counties in northern Michigan, an area that skews Republican. The time of the FBI's swoop came as Ms Whitmer's lockdown orders drew thousands of protesters to the state capitol, where many legally entered government buildings with semi-automatic rifles and other firearms.

The April 3 imagery from Planet shows a new so-called crosscut tunnel, according to Jeffery Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe telltale sign is the pile of spoil in front of the tunnel. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rock from inside the mountain as they dig the new tunnel,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Lewis said. The crosscut tunnel intersects with one of the main tunnels beyond the entrance, providing a shorter distance to the underground launch area. In 2018, North Korea exploded the original entrance to the tunnel but likely did not destroy the entire underground structure. This comes as North Korea may be preparing to take \u201a\u00c4\u00faanother provocative action\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 next week in connection with Pyongyang\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s April 15 holiday celebrating the birthday of the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s founding father, Kim Il Sung, according to the State Department\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s special representative for North Korea, Sung Kim. Concern grows that North Korea is preparing for first underground nuclear test in years Kim told reporters Wednesday that he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to speculate about what specific action Pyongyang might take, but he raised the prospect that it could be a nuclear test, as well as another missile launch. North Korea has conducted more than a dozen missile tests this year, including several ballistic missile launches. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are worried that in connection with the upcoming April 15 anniversary that the DPRK may be tempted to take another provocative action. We obviously hope not, but we will be prepared,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said, referring to the Democratic People\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Republic of Korea, North Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s official name. Kim reiterated that the US has publicly and privately delivered the message to North Korea that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s willing to engage diplomatically, but he said the US has yet to receive a response. The United States and allies believe that North Korea is beginning to prepare for a possible underground nuclear test for the first time since 2017. North Korea has recently resumed digging tunnels and construction activities at its underground nuclear test site, according to five US officials. Commercially available satellite imagery had shown some indications of activity on the surface at Pyongyang\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remote Punggye-ri nuclear test site. It is not yet clear how soon the regime would be capable of testing a device at the site, as it depends on the pace of the activity, the officials say. The preparations for a possible underground nuclear test come after North Korea tested its first suspected intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017 last month. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe remain concerned about the North Koreans \u201a\u00c4\u00ec their attempt to continue to improve their nuclear capability as well as their ballistic missile capability,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Tuesday. Kirby declined to be more specific about what he was referring to regarding the regime\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nuclear capability. In 2018, North Korea appeared to destroy at least three nuclear tunnels, observation buildings, a metal foundry and living quarters at its Punggye-ri site, in a process observed by invited international journalists that CNN reported at the time. A CNN crew at the remote mountain site in the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s north witnessed explosions at nuclear tunnels 2, 3 and 4, from observation decks about 500 meters away. They were among two dozen journalists invited to the country to observe the apparent destruction of the site. The move was seen at the time as North Korea making a gesture toward denuclearization to the Trump administration, but in the wake of ongoing rhetoric, then-President Donald Trump canceled a planned meeting with leader Kim Jong Un. Officials told CNN that US and allied intelligence agencies assess that digging activities at previously shuttered underground tunnel areas are underway, which would be critical for the resumption of underground nuclear testing. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests at the site, which lies north of Pyongyang, the most recent and powerful of which was in September 2017. There are also indications that North Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s next ballistic missile test could come as soon as the next few weeks, one official said, though the official would not specify the reasons behind that assessment, and US officials say they believe Kim is likely to resume testing a nuclear weapon. The US intelligence community estimates North Korea could be ready to conduct a nuclear test this year, according to the annual threat assessment report by the director of national intelligence published last month. The DNI said nuclear testing and long-range missiles tests are \u201a\u00c4\u00falaying the groundwork for an increase in tensions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by the regime. The Defense Department is considering a package of military responses to North Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recent test of an improved intercontinental ballistic missiles that could range from flying bombers or sailing warships in the region to beefing up exercises and training, according to the defense officials. Japan and South Korea are being consulted on a potential decision and could be part of any show of force that is decided upon, the officials say. The concern that nuclear testing could resume in the near future comes as North Korea has demonstrated a missile that could potentially reach the US. The Pentagon is still assessing to what extent the missile is an improved version of previous launches. North Korea reports the missile had a maximum altitude of 3,905 miles and flew a distance of 681 miles with a flight time of 68 minutes. The missile test was accompanied with Hollywood-style edited video complete with a soundtrack and footage of Kim.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Explaining the decision, DeSantis said Ladapo was concerned that the vaccine was \u201a\u00c4\u00fabeing pushed on people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are not just going to follow the CDC in the state of Florida,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to do our own stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The guidance released Tuesday says that the risks of the vaccine outweigh its benefits in children who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have underlying health conditions. It cites reports of increased incidence of myocarditis \u201a\u00c4\u00ec inflammation of the heart muscle \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in 16- and 17-year-olds who got the Covid-19 vaccine. The study that the guidance uses to support this concern also found that the risk of myocarditis is rare, identifying 105.9 cases per 1 million doses of the mRNA vaccine given in 16- to 17-year-olds. Florida surgeon general favorably recommended after Democrats walk out of confirmation hearing The guidance also cites data from a clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found no cases of severe Covid-19 in a group of children ages 5 to 11, whether they received the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. However, that study found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing Covid-19 infection. The department also based the guidance off a New York-based study that found vaccine effectiveness for children ages 5 to 17 dropped significantly during the Omicron surge. But that research concluded that the vaccine continued to be effective against severe disease in children. That study is a preprint and has not been published in a peer-reviewed professional journal, so a note in bold at the top of the study advises that it should not be used to guide clinical practice. Health experts have been very critical of the department\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recommendations. CDC director rebukes DeSantis for scolding high school students over masks: 'It is absolutely their choice' In a statement Tuesday, Dr. Daniel P. McQuillen, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said his group \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrongly opposes the state of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to put politics over the health and safety of children. The Florida Surgeon General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to recommend against COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children flies in the face of the best medical guidance and only serves to further sow distrust in vaccines that have proven to be the safest, most effective defense against severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The head of the University of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health system sent an email Tuesday to staff that distanced the medical network from Ladapo in light of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Dr. David Nelson, the senior vice president for health affairs at the university and president of UF Health, told staff that Ladapo does not speak for the school and acknowledged that his opinions clash with those of other medical experts. Ladapo is a professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine through an agreement with the state. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. Nelson also assured staff that the university\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s position was that vaccines are \u201a\u00c4\u00fasafe and effective, with a very low risk of adverse outcomes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe recognize there is sometimes significant disagreement among knowledgeable individuals on policy issues surrounding the COVID pandemic.

The five-figure penalties on the two flyers accused of violence are part of $2m (\u00a31.5m) in fines levied this year. US airlines have seen record numbers of disruptive passengers since early 2021, with many incidents involving the refusal to wear an anti-viral facemask. The fines were announced by transport secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday. \"If you are on an airplane, don't be a jerk and don't endanger the flight crews and fellow passengers,\" he said in an appearance on ABC's The View. \"If you do, you will be fined by the FAA.\" In one incident, an American Airlines passenger travelling from Texas to North Carolina has been asked to pay a $81,950 fine for threatening to hurt a flight attendant. The attendant had offered to help the passenger after she fell into the aisle of the plane. The unnamed passenger then allegedly pushed an airline worker and tried to open the cabin door. While flight attendants attempted to restrain her, she repeatedly hit one staff member in the head. When she was placed in cuffs, \"she spit at, headbutted, bit and tried to kick the crew and other passengers\", the FAA said in a news release. In the other incident, the passenger was flying on Delta Air Lines from Las Vegas to Atlanta. She allegedly tried to \"hug and kiss the passenger seated next to her, walked to the front of the aircraft to try to exit during flight; refused to return to her seat; and bit another passenger multiple times\". That passenger, who is also unnamed, was physically restrained by crew members and has now been asked to pay a fine of $77,272. Neither incident involved a failure to adhere to Covid measures. In his interview with The View, Mr Buttigieg said the US would decide by 18 April on whether to extend the federal requirement to wear masks on planes and in airports. The FAA announced a \"zero-tolerance\" policy on unruly passengers in January 2021, and has issued some $7m in fines since then. They have recorded 7,060 air rage incidents and say around 70% involved masking rules. But the rate of incidents has now declined by 60% since its high last year.

Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, California, was ordered held on a $120,000 bond Tuesday and will appear for a preliminary court hearing\u00a0on March 25, the Justice Department said.

She was also branded on her right shoulder, but the exact content of the brand was unclear, according to court documents. She was found had bruises on her face, arm, thigh, ligature marks on her wrists and ankles and burns on parts of her body.

During an interview with federal and local investigators, Papini was warned that it was a crime to lie to federal agents upon being presented with evidence that she had not been abducted. Instead of retracting the story, she allegedly doubled down. Fox News has reached out to Papini's attorney for comment. The multi-state search for her and the five-year search for who reportedly kidnaped her diverted resources from other cases, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said. In total, the investigation costs $150,000, by conservative estimates, he said in a Facebook post last week. \"Not only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters, but in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain,\" he wrote. \"All of law enforcement in Shasta county was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling this case.\" Undated photo of Sherri Papini.

California woman accused of hoax kidnapping was driven by 'narcissistic behavior,' sheriff says The Justice Department says Papini made the whole thing up. She was arrested last Thursday and has been charged with making false statements to a law enforcement officer and mail fraud, the department said in a news release. Papini, who had been detained since her arrest, appeared before a judge via Zoom on Tuesday. US Magistrate Judge Jeremy Peterson ruled she could be released on an $120,000 bond, with certain conditions, including that her travel be limited to only one part of California, that she must receive psychiatric treatment, must surrender her passport and cannot use firearms, among other terms. The judge addressed Papini directly, warning her that if she violated those conditions, there would be further penalties.

Talbert said in the DOJ news release, \u201a\u00c4\u00faand that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted based on the defendant\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conduct.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out multiples times to Michael Borges, an attorney for Papini, for comment. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s virtual court appearance, Borges said his client has no intention to flee while she awaits trial. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s husband reported her missing November 2, 2016, after she failed to pick up her kids at day care. She was found three weeks later, alone on Interstate 5 about 140 miles from home. She told police she had been kidnapped by two women who wore masks and spoke Spanish. They held her at gunpoint, she said, kept her chained in a closet and branded her. But last week, the Justice Department said Papini was actually with an ex-boyfriend in Southern California and that she caused her own injuries in support of her abduction claim. In all, the cost of the investigation borne by public safety agencies was around $150,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a conservative estimate, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said in a statement on Facebook last week. But the cost isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t only measured in dollars, Johnson said. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case and her story diverted resources from real cases with real victims. Years ago, she told police she had been abducted, beaten and branded. Now she's charged with making it all up \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the sheriff said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faFinally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faall of law enforcement in Shasta (County) was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling (of) this case.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case cost the public in other ways, too. According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, between 2017 and 2021, Papini received $30,000 from the California Victim Compensation Board, which assists and reimburses victims of violent crimes for \u201a\u00c4\u00facrime-related expenses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 they suffer. In Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case, the affidavit says, $1,000 was used so Papini could buy blinds for her home and nearly $2,000 were paid to the ambulance provider who transported Papini after she was found. The rest of the money were payments for Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s therapy and treatment for anxiety and post-traumatic stress stemming from her supposed kidnapping. Then, there was the GoFundMe campaign that allegedly netted just over $49,000. Per the affidavit, donors were told the funds would be used to \u201a\u00c4\u00fafind and bring Sherri home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In fact, federal prosecutors say, more than $30,000 was withdrawn by a family member from the campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bank account and more than $11,000 was used to pay off the family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s personal credit cards. The remaining amount was \u201a\u00c4\u00faspent on personal expenses,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the affidavit says. A GoFundMe spokesperson told CNN the fundraiser has been removed from the platform and has not been actively receiving donations since 2016. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with law enforcement to assist with their ongoing investigation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the spokesperson said. Regarding the GoFundMe campaign, family spokesman Chris Thomas referred questions to Borges, the attorney for Papini. Last week, Thomas criticized Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s arrest, which the spokesperson said happened in front of her children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf requested, Sherri would have fully complied and come to the police station,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faas she has done multiple times before, where this could have been handled in a more appropriate way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini and her husband \u201a\u00c4\u00facooperated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with law enforcement, Thomas said, adding, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are confused by several aspects of the charges and hope to get clarification in the coming days.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Taylor Romine contributed to this report.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Maybe it was because the 9.2% he now owns is described as a passive stake, although those who know Musk do not expect it to stay that way for long. His first move was to launch a poll - asking whether people want an edit button, something long called for and perhaps something he personally needs. The new announcement that he will join Twitter's board comes as no surprise. In a tweet on Tuesday, Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal said \"through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board\".

Musk's 9.2%  stake in the social media company may sound small, but Dan Ives, from analyst firm Wedbush, describes it as \"eye-popping\" - equating to 73.5 million shares in the social network. Shares in the platform soared following Monday's revelation that the Tesla founder had become the largest shareholder in the company - meaning that stake has already grown in value and is now worth more than $3bn. Musk's shareholding is four times greater than that of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive in November. Mr Ives believes the South African entrepreneur now has his eyes \"laser set\" on Twitter, and his significant holding will see him push for an active role in the management of the company. \"We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,\" he said. Musk has something of a love-hate relationship with Twitter. He is a frequent tweeter, with more than 80 million followers - and no stranger to controversy in his interactions on the social media site. The platform seems to suit his impulsive personality - last year he famously asked if he should sell 10% of his stock in his electric car firm Tesla, to which Twitter users said 'yes'. It led to Musk selling around $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of shares in the firm in November. Months earlier he had offered to sign a cheque for $6bn if the World Food Programme (WFP) could explain how it would be used to solve hunger around the globe - after an assertion made by the head of the UN programme. But tweeting has also got him into trouble. A 2018 post about Tesla stock led to an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission which ended with an agreement requiring the firm's lawyers to pre-approve certain tweets. It is unclear if that actually happens. Interestingly, the Wall Street Journal reports that his Twitter share filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which under normal circumstances would include a line saying he doesn't intend to influence the company, came with a 'Not Applicable' mark. The timing of the deal has also raised questions and could once again put Musk at loggerheads with financial regulators. His investment in Twitter was filed on 14 March, but not announced until this week. US securities law requires disclosure within 10 days of acquiring 5% of a company. Musk uses Twitter not just as a barometer for how he runs his own companies, but also increasingly to take the temperature of the nation. Last month, after he had lodged his investment with the SEC - but before his shareholding became public knowledge - he asked users whether they believed that free speech was essential to a functioning democracy and whether Twitter adheres to this principle. Cornell University's assistant professor Alexandra Cirone thinks this is evidence he may use his new stake \"to try to influence Twitter practices\" and for a \"more active play in the social media eco-system\". But others see more immediate issues with his musings. Howard Fischer, partner at law firm Moses & Singer, told Reuters that, given he had already bought a stake in Twitter, these questions could be seen as a form of market manipulation. \"I do suspect the SEC is going to look long and hard into whether they can bring manipulation charges, along with the failure to file,\" he said. Mr Agrawal is clearly watching his every move. In response to his edit button poll, which currently has 2.6 million responses, he urged voters to do so \"carefully\". Allow Twitter content?

Jack Dorsey had always rejected the idea, and critics point out that it could allow people to fundamentally change the meaning of tweets after they have been shared. It would be a big change for Twitter to include an edit button, and Musk is clearly keen to be part of that conversation. For a while last month, it looked as if Musk was intent on building a new social media platform as a rival to Twitter - and there he does have precedent from another prolific and controversial tweeter. Donald Trump, who was banned from Twitter in January 2021 after the Capitol riots, announced last autumn that he was launching his own social network - dubbed Truth Social - to \"stand up to the tyranny of big tech\". But six weeks after its launch, there is a waiting list of 1.5 million who are unable to use it - with the platform branded a disaster by Joshua Tucker, director of NYU's Center for social media and politics. According to Reuters, two key executives quit after the troubled launch. For those with shares in Musk's many other businesses - Space X, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company - there will doubtless be a sigh of relief that he didn't go down the same route as Mr Trump. But there will also be concerns that he has yet another passion project to distract him from the serious business of running his established firms. Not to mention the issues that might now be raised about the Twitter deal by the SEC. Social media expert Casey Newton points out that it is not the first time a big tech firm has eyed Twitter. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once bought a four percent share of the company \"and essentially did nothing with it,\" he writes. But he goes on to say that Ballmer never tweeted like Musk did: \"gleefully, annoyingly, constantly\". And it seems most likely that it will be from this Twitter account that Musk will let the world know what he intends to do next.

Tanner Brass was found dead hours after police arrested his mother, Kyla Frenchman, when she argued with them about her son's safety, she said. The boy's father, Kaij Brass, has been charged with second-degree murder. Indigenous leaders say Ms Frenchman was racially profiled and have demanded the local police chief's resignation. Two Canadian police officers in the city of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, have been suspended. Police responded to reports of a domestic dispute in the early hours of 10 February and found Ms Frenchman standing outside the apartment building, she said. Ms Frenchman told the officers she had been kicked out of her apartment and feared her 13-month-old son was in danger. She said the officers told her to wait outside and entered the building, only to return shortly afterwards and say no-one had answered the door. Ms Frenchman said when she demanded the officers check on Tanner, she was arrested for suspected intoxication. She denies being drunk. Several hours later police were called back to the same home to reports of a homicide involving a child. They found Tanner dead and Kaij Brass was arrested. Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Kyla Frenchman struggled to speak as she demanded justice for her son. Standing with friends and relatives, she spoke of her son as a \"happy baby\" with a big smile. A statement read on her behalf said she had \"begged and pleaded\" with police to help her and her child after they arrived at their home. It went on: \"Instead, they accused me of being drunk. They put me in handcuffs and they put me in a cell.\" A statement from the Prince Albert police department described the boy's death as a tragedy. It added: \"As an organisation, there is nothing we can say to lessen the grief and torment at this shocking loss of a deeply loved child from our community.\" But Heather Bear, Vice-Chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, said: \"If these officers showed up to a domestic dispute call involving a young white family, knowing that an infant was inside and possibly in danger, do you think they would have arrested the mother and left?\" Police have not responded to this allegation. Earlier this month, the department's chief, Jon Bergen, suspended the two officers involved with pay. Last week, 95% of the union representing Prince Albert officers supported a vote of no confidence in Mr Bergen's leadership. Ms Frenchman said in her statement she believed Tanner would still be alive \"if they had listened to me\". An investigation into the boy's death is ongoing.

Russia attempted to pay in rubles for two dollar-denominated bonds that matured on April 4, S&P said in a note on Friday. The agency said this amounted to a \u201a\u00c4\u00faselective default\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because investors are unlikely to be able to convert the rubles into \u201a\u00c4\u00fadollars equivalent to the originally due amounts.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 According to S&P, a selective default is declared when an entity has defaulted on a specific obligation but not its entire debt. Moscow has a grace period of 30 days from April 4 to make the payments of capital and interest, but S&P said it does not expect it will convert them into dollars given Western sanctions that undermine its \u201a\u00c4\u00fawillingness and technical abilities to honor the terms and conditions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of its obligations. A full foreign currency default would be Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first in more than a century, when Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated bonds issued by the Tsarist government. Russia cannot access roughly $315 billion of its foreign currency reserves as a result of Western sanctions imposed following its invasion of Ukraine. Until last week, the United States allowed Russia to use some of its frozen assets to pay back certain investors in dollars. But the US Treasury has since blocked the country from accessing its reserves at American banks, part of its effort to ramp up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and further diminish his war chest. JPMorgan estimates that Russia had about $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of last year, with about half of that held by foreign investors. Russia is now planning legal action. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will sue, because we undertook all necessary action so that investors would receive their payments,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will show the court proof of our payments, to confirm our efforts to pay in rubles, just as we did in foreign currency. It won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be a simple process,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. He did not say who Russia planned to sue. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a press conference last week that any default would be \u201a\u00c4\u00faartificial\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because Russia has the dollars to pay \u201a\u00c4\u00ee it just can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t access them. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are no grounds for a real default,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Peskov said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot even close.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Russia has gone to great lengths to artificially prop up the ruble \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which sank by as much as 40% to less than one US cent in the days after the invasion \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including by hiking interest rates to 20%, and by forcing exporters to swap most of their foreign currency revenues for rubles. That measure is still in place but the central bank has decided to relax some other restrictions, Reuters reported Monday, and last week announced that it was cutting interest rates to 17%. The ruble was trading at 79 to the US dollar on Monday, according to data from Refinitiv.

In their appeal filed Monday, Trump and his children Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. argued that if New York Attorney General Letitia James wants their testimony, she should bring them before a state grand jury investigating the Trump Organization, where witnesses receive transactional immunity for their testimony in New York. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys wrote that if the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office is allowed to depose their clients, the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s constitutional and statutory protections can easily be \u201a\u00c4\u00faeviscerated if the same agency involved in the criminal investigation simply opens up a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2civil\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 investigation into the very same matters.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe question is whether the (Office of the Attorney General) can use the office subpoenas to avoid the grand jury process and compel testimony from those whom it does not wish to grant immunity,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the appeal states. A state judge ruled against the Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 request in February, saying they could invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refuse to answer questions, which Eric Trump did during his 2020 deposition. Attorneys for the Trump family argued that a jury could draw an \u201a\u00c4\u00faadverse inference\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if the Trumps opted not to answer questions in depositions. New York Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron had ordered the Trumps to sit for depositions by March 10, but the former President and his children reached a deal to delay those appearances until after an appeal is decided. James said in court filings in January that her office\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s civil investigation had uncovered significant evidence that the Trump Organization used \u201a\u00c4\u00fafraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage and tax deductions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and that financial statements had numerous \u201a\u00c4\u00famisleading statements and omissions.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 A parallel criminal investigation conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office has been looking into the former President and his business and whether they misled lenders, insurers and others by providing false or misleading financial statements about property values. But the investigation has reached an impasse, and two top attorneys resigned earlier this month after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he was not prepared to authorize an indictment against the former President, CNN previously reported. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys wrote that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faundisputed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that the criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office targets the valuations and appraisals of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s properties in financial statements to taxing authorities and financial institutions, just as the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigation does. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys cited a filing from the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office in January where it writes that \u201a\u00c4\u00facoordination between parallel civil and criminal proceedings is standard procedure.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In their appeal, the Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys also ask the appellate court to reverse Engoron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision and allow there to be a hearing on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fascope and extent of coordination\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 between the Manhattan district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office and the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys want to ask whether two attorneys from James\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 office are providing information or reporting back to the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. The Trumps also want to ask whether the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office is providing all of the information it has collected to the district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office, and whether it would immediately provide subpoenaed testimony to the district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office, among other questions. In a statement shortly after the appeal was filed, James said her office will continue to follow the facts. \u201a\u00c4\u00faDonald J. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump were ordered by a judge to comply with our investigation into Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial dealings,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 James said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faDespite continuous efforts to impede this investigation, no one can stop our pursuit of justice, no matter how powerful they are.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Attorneys for the Trumps again outlined public statements made by James about Donald Trump in their appeal, calling them \u201a\u00c4\u00faan extraordinary and unprecedented barrage of inappropriate public statements\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 since she ran for office in 2018, threatening to investigate and prosecute Trump and those close to him.

The pioneering procedure was done to save his life, but could also revolutionise the field of organ transplantation, they hope. The donated thymus tissue should help stop his body rejecting the new heart. Months on from the surgery, tests reveal Easton is progressing well. The thymus tissue is working, meaning his body is building critical immune cells which might ultimately reduce or even eliminate the need for him to take lifelong anti-rejection drugs. One of his doctors, Joseph Turek from Duke University Hospital, said: \"We are very excited about it. This concept of tolerance has always been the holy grail in transplantation, and we are now on the doorstep. \"This has the potential to change the face of solid organ transplantation in the future.\" The thymus gland helps the development of T-cells, which fight foreign substances in the body. It teaches these immune cells what is \"self\" and what isn't, and therefore what can be attacked. Giving Easton cultured thymus tissue from the same donor who gave him a heart, should help his body adopt the new tissues, his doctors believe. Easton was born with a weak heart as well as problems with his immune system. He spent his first seven months in hospital - some of it on life support - and needed numerous heart operations. as well as treatment for recurrent infections that his body was unable to fight on its own. His mother, Kaitlyn Sinnamon, recalls: \"It helped some, but it was basically a band aid for us to make it through transplant.\" His doctors applied to the medical regulatory body, the FDA, to carry out an experimental type of transplant that hadn't been done in combination before, as far as they knew. Since Easton needed a new heart and, independently, a new thymus gland, the FDA granted approval for the procedures that went ahead in August 2021, when Easton was six months old. Dr Turek said: \"This was very serendipitous. We had the expertise to do both. \"The work we had done in the laboratory was based around using thymus along with heart transplantation in order to develop tolerance - so basically retraining the immune system and having the thymus of the same donor and heart grow up together. \"We thought this was an opportunity for Easton. This could be applied to all solid organs down the road potentially if this works.\" Much more research is needed before then, including checking if it is viable to remove and replace the thymus in people who have one that is already fully functioning. The medical team plan to wean Easton off the immunosuppressive drugs at some point, to see how he progresses. Kaitlyn said: \"I hope that as he gets older he gets to be proud of his scars, and know that he not only got to save his own life, but got to save other people's lives as well.\" US man gets pig heart in world-first transplant Pig kidney transplanted into brain-dead person Duke Health\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The eldest Biden grandchild, 28, and her fianc\u00e9, Peter Neal, 24, will celebrate at perhaps the most exclusive venue in the US. Ms Biden said she was \"endlessly grateful\" to her \"Nana and Pop\" for the honour. Four other wedding receptions have ever been held at the presidential home. Ms Biden, a graduate of Columbia Law School and the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, announced her engagement to Mr Neal, a law student at the University of Pennsylvania, in September. Ms Biden will only be the fifth bride to have a White House wedding reception, to be held in November. The previous one took place in 2008, when Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former president George W Bush, celebrated a month after she was wed in Texas. It has actually been more common to hold wedding ceremonies themselves at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - there have been 18 in total. Since the first White House wedding in 1812 - between the sister of First Lady Dolley Madison and Thomas Todd - most have involved close family members of the first couple. The wedding of Nellie Grant, daughter of President Ulysses S Grant, in May 1874, was seen as the most elaborate event ever held at the White House at the time. Two hundred and fifty guests gathered in the East Room, decorated with masses of white flowers and Nellie's white satin dress fell into a six-foot train. Still, like many weddings, it was also a stressful affair. Mr and Mrs Grant were said to be concerned about their 19-year-old daughter's wedding to Algernon Sartoris, a diplomat. One sitting president has said \"I do\" at the White House: President Grover Cleveland wed Frances Folson in the Blue Room in June 1886. Other recent White House weddings have included those of Lynda Bird Johnson - daughter of President Lyndon Johnson - who married Charles Spittal Robb in a grand event in the East Room in 1967. In 1971, Tricia Nixon - daughter of President Richard Nixon and Pat Nixon, was the first to hold a wedding in the White House Rose Garden. The latest White House wedding, in 2013, was one of just three not involving family of the president. Pete Souza, who was chief White House photographer under President Barack Obama, married fianc\u00e9e Pattie Lease in the Rose Garden.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

Centrist Macron and Le Pen, a long-time standard-bearer for the French far-right, were the top two candidates in the first round of Sunday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote, picking up 27.8% and 23.2% of the ballots respectively, according to the French Interior Ministry. Twelve candidates ran for the top job. Since none of them received more than 50% of the ballots in the first round, the top two candidates will face each other in a runoff on April 24. The first round of the 2022 contest was marked by voter apathy, with participation estimated at 73.3%, according to an analysis by pollster Ifop-Fiducial for French broadcasters TF1 and LCI \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the lowest in a first round in 20 years. While Macron received more votes than any of the other candidates in the first round, he is a polarizing figure whose approval rating has sagged during his first term. In a speech after polls closed on Sunday, he urged citizens to vote in the second round. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNothing is settled and the debate that we will have in the coming 15 days is decisive for our country and our Europe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want a France which, having left Europe, would have as its only allies the international populists and xenophobes. That is not us. I want a France faithful to humanism, to the spirit of enlightenment,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Macron is seeking to become the first French president to win reelection since Jacques Chirac in 2002. Polls have given him a consistent edge over the rest of the field, but the race has tightened significantly in the past month. Polling by Ifop-Fiducial released on Sunday showed that Macron would win a second-round contest against Le Pen by just 51% to 49%. Le Pen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s support has steadily risen in recent weeks. Though she is best known for her far-right policies such as drastically restricting immigration and banning Muslim headscarves in public places, she has run a more mainstream campaign this time around, softening her language and focusing more on pocketbook issues like the rising cost of living, a top concern for the French electorate. In her speech Sunday, Le Pen vowed to be a president for \u201a\u00c4\u00faall the French\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if she wins the second round, and called on those who didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t vote for Macron to support her in the second round. Leftist firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon came third, with 22% of the vote. He enjoyed a late surge in support and was considered a possible dark horse candidate to challenge Macron. Who Melenchon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voters choose to back in the second round could decide the presidency, experts say. Melenchon told his supporters that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe must not give a single vote to Mrs. Le Pen,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but did not explicitly back Macron. No other candidate received more than 10% of the votes. Far-right political commentator turned presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, who enjoyed a seat among the top three candidates until March, according to Ifop polling, came in fourth at 7.1%. The other candidates on Sunday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ballot have quickly begun throwing their weight behind the top two. While Zemmour called on his backers to vote for Le Pen, the others urged their supporters to steer clear of her. The candidates from the traditional center-left and center-right parties, the Socialists and the Republicans, have already backed Macron. Socialist Anne Hidalgo said a Le Pen victory would instill in France \u201a\u00c4\u00faa hatred of everyone set against everyone,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while Republican Valerie Pecresse said she was sincerely worried for the country because \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe far right has never been so close to winning.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe project of Marine Le Pen will open France to discord, impotence, and collapse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Pecresse. Macron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s political rise shattered the playing field, as his centrist political party has pulled supporters away from the traditional centrist parties, the Socialists and the Republicans. Both its candidates polled under 5% on Sunday. Surveys ahead of the race showed that a second round of Macron vs. Le Pen was the most likely outcome. Macron handily beat Le Pen five years ago, but experts have said that a second contest between the two would be much tighter than the 2017 race. Macron is no longer a political upstart and must run on a mixed record. While his ambitious plan to bolster the European Union\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s autonomy and geopolitical heft won him respect abroad and at home, he remains a divisive figure when it comes to domestic policies. His handling of the yellow vest movement, one of France\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most prolonged protests in decades, was widely panned, and his record on the Covid-19 pandemic is inconclusive. Macron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signature policy during the crisis \u201a\u00c4\u00ec requiring people to show proof of vaccination to go about their lives as normal \u201a\u00c4\u00ec helped increase vaccination rates but fired up a vocal minority against his presidency. Macron has, so far, done very little campaigning. Experts believe his strategy was to avoid the political mudslinging as long as possible to brandish his image as the most presidential of all the candidates. Polling showed him consistently leading all candidates, and he was considered a shoo-in to make the second round. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe widespread dissatisfaction with Macron (especially among the young) means that the outcome is uncertain and unpredictable. Le Pen will continue to exploit this, and a major political upset therefore remains possible,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said CNN European affairs commentator Dominic Thomas of the second round matchup. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHowever much they may dislike Le Pen, there is a world of difference between her and Macron, and how she would disrupt European and global politics.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Le Pen is the daughter of another famous far-right presidential candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen. The elder Le Pen made it to the runoff against Jacques Chirac in 2002, but Marine Le Pen has managed to perform better than her father in the first round of each of the past two presidential elections. Le Pen has tried to portray herself as a very different candidate to the one who lost to Macron in 2017, when she attempted to position herself to the forgotten French working classes as her country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s answer to then-US President Donald Trump. While her economic nationalist stance, views on immigration, euroskepticism and positions on Islam in France are unchanged, Le Pen has sought to broaden her appeal. The contest was at first predicted to be a referendum on the dominance of the extreme right in French politics, but the war in Ukraine \u201a\u00c4\u00ec another key issue for voters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec upended the race. According to Ifop polling, Macron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s support peaked in early March, as potential voters rallied around the flag and rewarded the president for his attempts to mediate the conflict in Ukraine before Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion, even if it was a failure. Many experts also expected the war to hurt the Le Pen, who had been a vocal admirer of Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader who has become a pariah in the West due to the Kremlin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to invade Ukraine in late February. Le Pen visited the Russian president during her 2017 campaign; this time around, she was forced to scrap a leaflet with a photo of her and Putin from that trip after Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unprovoked attack on its neighbor. Thomas, the CNN European affairs commentator, explained that the forthcoming debates will be crucial if Macron is to convince voters that Le Pen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s previous support for Putin should disqualify her. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe will be vulnerable on a range of domestic issues, but she will have difficulty convincing the electorate of her foreign policy credentials, especially given her longstanding links with Russia,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.

Tanner Brass was found dead hours after police arrested his mother, Kyla Frenchman, when she argued with them about her son's safety, she said. The boy's father, Kaij Brass, has been charged with second-degree murder. Indigenous leaders say Ms Frenchman was racially profiled and have demanded the local police chief's resignation. Two Canadian police officers in the city of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, have been suspended. Police responded to reports of a domestic dispute in the early hours of 10 February and found Ms Frenchman standing outside the apartment building, she said. Ms Frenchman told the officers she had been kicked out of her apartment and feared her 13-month-old son was in danger. She said the officers told her to wait outside and entered the building, only to return shortly afterwards and say no-one had answered the door. Ms Frenchman said when she demanded the officers check on Tanner, she was arrested for suspected intoxication. She denies being drunk. Several hours later police were called back to the same home to reports of a homicide involving a child. They found Tanner dead and Kaij Brass was arrested. Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Kyla Frenchman struggled to speak as she demanded justice for her son. Standing with friends and relatives, she spoke of her son as a \"happy baby\" with a big smile. A statement read on her behalf said she had \"begged and pleaded\" with police to help her and her child after they arrived at their home. It went on: \"Instead, they accused me of being drunk. They put me in handcuffs and they put me in a cell.\" A statement from the Prince Albert police department described the boy's death as a tragedy. It added: \"As an organisation, there is nothing we can say to lessen the grief and torment at this shocking loss of a deeply loved child from our community.\" But Heather Bear, Vice-Chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, said: \"If these officers showed up to a domestic dispute call involving a young white family, knowing that an infant was inside and possibly in danger, do you think they would have arrested the mother and left?\" Police have not responded to this allegation. Earlier this month, the department's chief, Jon Bergen, suspended the two officers involved with pay. Last week, 95% of the union representing Prince Albert officers supported a vote of no confidence in Mr Bergen's leadership. Ms Frenchman said in her statement she believed Tanner would still be alive \"if they had listened to me\". An investigation into the boy's death is ongoing.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Wake Forest University Medical School is standing by a student who suggested she intentionally harmed one of her patients for disagreeing with her about transgender ideology. The student, fourth-year Kychelle Del Rosario, came under fire after appearing to boast about the incident on Twitter in late March. The university responded with a brief suspension but announced no further consequences in its latest statement. Del Rosario tweeted: \"I had a patient I was doing a blood draw on see my pronoun pin and loudly laugh to the staff \u2018She/Her? Well of course it is! What other pronouns even are there?\u2019 I missed his vein so he had to get stuck twice.\" The university publicly responded to the incident in a statement on Wednesday, saying Del Rosario's tweet was not an accurate recounting of the incident. \"Our documentation verifies that after the student physician was unsuccessful in obtaining the blood draw, the student appropriately deferred a second attempt to one of our certified professionals. The student did not attempt to draw blood again,\" the school wrote. ETHICS PROFESSOR SLAMS MEDICAL STUDENT WHO IMPLIED SHE STUCK A PATIENT FOR MOCKING HER PRONOUN PIN The university's statement included a lengthy apology letter from Del Rosario, in which she claims she never intended to harm the individual, blaming the missed vein on inexperience. \"For the event mentioned in the tweet, I was performing a blood draw on a patient and during our conversation they had shown dismay at my pronoun pin,\" Del Rosario wrote, according to the university newspaper. \"I calmly shared my thoughts about pronouns and did not escalate the situation further. When I was doing the blood draw, I missed the first time due to my inexperience as a student, and per our policy, my supervisor performed the successful blood draw the second time. During this encounter, I never intended to harm the patient.\" \"I am truly sorry for poorly representing our school and our health system. I will reflect on responsible social media use as a professional and my duty to care for all my patients, regardless of any differences of belief,\" she concluded. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Del Rosario's actions led to heavy criticism on social media, many of her fellow Wake Forest students jumped to defend her. One op-ed published in the school's newspaper was titled \"Criticism of Wake Forest medical student is excessive.\" \"The crux of the issue at hand is not the conduct of Del Rosario, but the bigotry expressed by her patient,\" claimed the author, opinions editor and sophomore Sophie Guymon. \"It is appalling that the vast majority of the media coverage surrounding Del Rosario\u2019s tweet is critiquing her lack of professionalism rather than her patient\u2019s display of bigotry.\" Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal was \u201a\u00c4\u00fatenable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal is a tenable one.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was \u201a\u00c4\u00faultimately one for the Polish government,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces. The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe prospect of fighter jets \u201a\u00c4\u00f2at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either. US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so. Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday. Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s. Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine. A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere (she) ought to have heard about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nuland told lawmakers. The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faready to deploy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec immediately and free of charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said. Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country. By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in \u201a\u00c4\u00fainteragency\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 discussions to \u201a\u00c4\u00faexamine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine. Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland. Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized. The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn fact, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re handing over to the Ukrainians? We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in very active discussions with them about that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said Sunday. A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely. Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.

More than 900 civilians killed in a matter of weeks. Is Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal? His country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine has presented reams of evidence that have led some world leaders \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including US President Joe Biden last week \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to use the loaded label. The question now is what Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which he followed up by calling Putin a \u201a\u00c4\u00famurderous dictator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapure thug\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will mean for the war in Ukraine going forward. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t signal any concern that Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks would roil talks with Russia. He told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Fareed Zakaria that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faready for negotiations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with Putin. (More on this in a minute.) Biden's strategy with Putin is decades in the making Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments represented a major moment since leading officials had mostly avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. But soon after the President uttered the words \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think he is a war criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to reporters at an unrelated event, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the comment was \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom the heart.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Other officials used similar language. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hard not to walk away with that conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 State Department spokesman Ned Price later told CNN. And after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he \u201a\u00c4\u00fapersonally\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 agreed with Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s label of Putin, Psaki told reporters that the top US diplomat was speaking from the heart \u201a\u00c4\u00faas well.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Why all the parsing? While terms like \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar crimes\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are often used colloquially, they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Conventions, which specify intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime. In other words, the White House is being careful to not get ahead of the international investigations probing Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Will Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s words complicate Ukraine-Russia negotiations? The Kremlin called Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks about Putin being a war criminal \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Asked if it would be hard to sit down with Putin, Zelensky maintained Sunday that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ready \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and has been ready. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout delay,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 warning that otherwise Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s losses would be \u201a\u00c4\u00fahuge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The problem, as CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security team reports, is that US and NATO officials believe Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s engagement truly is \u201a\u00c4\u00ec even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Everything you need to know about war crimes and how Putin could be prosecuted The view from the State Department. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday also expressed her personal view that war crimes are being committed in Russia, saying that they \u201a\u00c4\u00faall feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but noted that there must be \u201a\u00c4\u00faa body of proof\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 before a legal determination can be made. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there is virtually no one \u201a\u00c4\u00ec maybe Vladimir Putin is the exception \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who can look at all of the photographs, all of video coming from Ukraine and not believe that Putin is intentionally targeting civilians, and intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in an interview with CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s John Berman on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow, I think we all feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sherman said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in terms of international law, you have to have evidence, you have to have a body of proof that in fact there was intentionality.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added that the United States is \u201a\u00c4\u00fahelping to pull that evidence together, present it to international justice parties and then have a legal threshold that is met.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 How long do war crime investigations take? Investigations at the International Criminal Court take many years, and only a handful of convictions have ever been won. Put differently, it could be a while before Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 remarks have any legal weight \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if ever. As we noted earlier this month, the court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia.

The April 3 imagery from Planet shows a new so-called crosscut tunnel, according to Jeffery Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe telltale sign is the pile of spoil in front of the tunnel. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rock from inside the mountain as they dig the new tunnel,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Lewis said. The crosscut tunnel intersects with one of the main tunnels beyond the entrance, providing a shorter distance to the underground launch area. In 2018, North Korea exploded the original entrance to the tunnel but likely did not destroy the entire underground structure. This comes as North Korea may be preparing to take \u201a\u00c4\u00faanother provocative action\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 next week in connection with Pyongyang\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s April 15 holiday celebrating the birthday of the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s founding father, Kim Il Sung, according to the State Department\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s special representative for North Korea, Sung Kim. Concern grows that North Korea is preparing for first underground nuclear test in years Kim told reporters Wednesday that he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to speculate about what specific action Pyongyang might take, but he raised the prospect that it could be a nuclear test, as well as another missile launch. North Korea has conducted more than a dozen missile tests this year, including several ballistic missile launches. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are worried that in connection with the upcoming April 15 anniversary that the DPRK may be tempted to take another provocative action. We obviously hope not, but we will be prepared,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said, referring to the Democratic People\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Republic of Korea, North Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s official name. Kim reiterated that the US has publicly and privately delivered the message to North Korea that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s willing to engage diplomatically, but he said the US has yet to receive a response. The United States and allies believe that North Korea is beginning to prepare for a possible underground nuclear test for the first time since 2017. North Korea has recently resumed digging tunnels and construction activities at its underground nuclear test site, according to five US officials. Commercially available satellite imagery had shown some indications of activity on the surface at Pyongyang\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remote Punggye-ri nuclear test site. It is not yet clear how soon the regime would be capable of testing a device at the site, as it depends on the pace of the activity, the officials say. The preparations for a possible underground nuclear test come after North Korea tested its first suspected intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017 last month. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe remain concerned about the North Koreans \u201a\u00c4\u00ec their attempt to continue to improve their nuclear capability as well as their ballistic missile capability,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Tuesday. Kirby declined to be more specific about what he was referring to regarding the regime\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nuclear capability. In 2018, North Korea appeared to destroy at least three nuclear tunnels, observation buildings, a metal foundry and living quarters at its Punggye-ri site, in a process observed by invited international journalists that CNN reported at the time. A CNN crew at the remote mountain site in the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s north witnessed explosions at nuclear tunnels 2, 3 and 4, from observation decks about 500 meters away. They were among two dozen journalists invited to the country to observe the apparent destruction of the site. The move was seen at the time as North Korea making a gesture toward denuclearization to the Trump administration, but in the wake of ongoing rhetoric, then-President Donald Trump canceled a planned meeting with leader Kim Jong Un. Officials told CNN that US and allied intelligence agencies assess that digging activities at previously shuttered underground tunnel areas are underway, which would be critical for the resumption of underground nuclear testing. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests at the site, which lies north of Pyongyang, the most recent and powerful of which was in September 2017. There are also indications that North Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s next ballistic missile test could come as soon as the next few weeks, one official said, though the official would not specify the reasons behind that assessment, and US officials say they believe Kim is likely to resume testing a nuclear weapon. The US intelligence community estimates North Korea could be ready to conduct a nuclear test this year, according to the annual threat assessment report by the director of national intelligence published last month. The DNI said nuclear testing and long-range missiles tests are \u201a\u00c4\u00falaying the groundwork for an increase in tensions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by the regime. The Defense Department is considering a package of military responses to North Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recent test of an improved intercontinental ballistic missiles that could range from flying bombers or sailing warships in the region to beefing up exercises and training, according to the defense officials. Japan and South Korea are being consulted on a potential decision and could be part of any show of force that is decided upon, the officials say. The concern that nuclear testing could resume in the near future comes as North Korea has demonstrated a missile that could potentially reach the US. The Pentagon is still assessing to what extent the missile is an improved version of previous launches. North Korea reports the missile had a maximum altitude of 3,905 miles and flew a distance of 681 miles with a flight time of 68 minutes. The missile test was accompanied with Hollywood-style edited video complete with a soundtrack and footage of Kim.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

Jackson said that she was a beneficiary of the Civil Rights Act passed in the decade before she was born, hardworking parents who gave her an African name \u201a\u00c4\u00ec \u201a\u00c4\u00faKetanji Onyika\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00falovely one\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and those who came before her, including Judge Constance Baker Motley, the first African American woman to be appointed to the federal bench. But Jackson, like some previous Supreme Court nominees, gave little hint of her personal judicial philosophy, saying she decides cases \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom a neutral posture\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and interprets the law \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout fear or favor, consistent with my judicial oath.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and the grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Jackson. Democrats touted President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pick as a qualified, boundary-breaking nominee, while some Republicans criticized her record on crime and the support she holds from left-wing groups. Jackson, 51, sits on DC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement. Jackson worked as a clerk for Breyer, a federal public defender, an attorney in private practice, a federal district court judge and a member of the US Sentencing Commission. At the hearing Monday, Jackson and the senators delivered their opening statements establishing the arguments for and against her confirmation. She was introduced by Judge Thomas Griffith, formerly of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Lisa Fairfax, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, her daughters Leila and Talia, and her husband Patrick were sitting behind her. Jackson will answer questions from the members on Tuesday and Wednesday, and witnesses will testify on Thursday. Democrats hope to confirm Jackson by early April. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, opened the hearing by putting Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination in historical context, noting that of 115 Supreme Court justices, 108 have been white men. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot a single justice has been a Black woman,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Durbin said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou, Judge Jackson, can be the first.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not easy being the first,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut your presence here today, your willingness to brave this process, will give inspiration to millions of Americans who see themselves in you.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 No Democratic senators have signaled they will oppose Jackson, and some Republicans have expressed openness to supporting her. In the 50-50 Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris could break a tied vote and confirm Jackson to the Supreme Court. READ: Ketanji Brown Jackson's opening statement at her Supreme Court confirmation hearing But many Republican senators are expected to oppose the nomination and some preemptively defended themselves from any criticisms that voting against Jackson would be perceived as sexist or racist, noting that Democrats have opposed diverse picks in the past because of their judicial philosophy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be looking to see whether Judge Jackson is committed to the Constitution as originally understood,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Republicans previewed on Monday their attempts to portray Jackson as weak on crime. Grassley said in his opening statement that there are two types of nominees who have worked criminal cases: \u201a\u00c4\u00faBill of Rights attorneys who want to protect defendants\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 constitutional rights\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facriminal defense lawyers who disagree with our criminal laws.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faOf course, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a very important difference,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Grassley said. Some Republican senators indicated that they will press Jackson for advocating on behalf of detainees at Guant\u221a\u00b0namo Bay in private practice after representing them as a public defender. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m a bit troubled by some of the positions you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve taken and arguments that you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made representing people who have committed terrorist acts against the United States and other dangerous criminals,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has raised concerns about Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s record on sentencing in child pornography cases. Hawley said on Twitter last week that there is \u201a\u00c4\u00faan alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s treatment of sex offenders, especially those preying on children.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Democrats have refuted Republicans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attacks since her nomination. When Biden gave a speech announcing his pick in February, he made sure to note that Jackson came from \u201a\u00c4\u00faa family of law enforcement, with her brother and uncles having served as police officers.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 GOP senators push misleading portrayal of Ketanji Brown Jackson's record on child porn cases The White House and Senate Democrats have pushed back on Hawley\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attack, noting that Jackson has the support of law enforcement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police, and dozens of former state attorneys general. They noted she has already been confirmed by the Senate three times. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn the vast majority of cases involving child sex crimes, the sentences Judge Jackson imposed were consistent with or above what the government or US probation recommended,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. A CNN review of the material in question shows that Jackson has mostly followed the common judicial sentencing practices in these kinds of cases and that Hawley took some of her comments out of context by suggesting they were opinions, rather than follow-up questions to subject-matter experts. It has become a norm among judges to issue sentences below the guidelines in certain child pornography cases that don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t involve producing the pornography itself. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSome have said that the federal sentencing guidelines are too harsh on child sex crimes, especially child pornography,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Hawley on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll just be honest. I can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say that I agree with that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 There are other matters Republicans may probe. During Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s confirmation hearings last year, some Senate Republicans focused on a 2019 case she heard between the House Judiciary Committee, which was looking into then-President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s possible obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Russia investigation, and former White House counsel Don McGahn. Ongoing cases involving Trump and the powers of government could land before her on the Supreme Court, including disputes over whether Congress can access Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial records and whether Trump could be held accountable by private litigants for the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Last year, Grassley challenged Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s declaration that \u201a\u00c4\u00fapresidents are not kings\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and suggested she was engaged in a kind of hyperbole. Senate Republicans have also pushed for Jackson to publicly oppose efforts to expand the court, which activists on the left have called for since they blocked then-President Barack Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 and then expanded, under Trump, the high court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conservative majority from 5-4 to 6-3. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination to replace another liberal will not change the ideological balance of the court. Confirmation hearings to spotlight rightward trajectory of America's highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00faNine is a number that works,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe must protect the court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Still, even those who may oppose Jackson expect the hearings this week to be less contentious than those in the Trump era, which altered the balance of the court and, in the case of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, centered on allegations of sexual assault. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMost of us couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go back to our offices during Kavanaugh without getting spit on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Graham to his Democratic colleagues. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI hope that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t happen to y\u201a\u00c4\u00f4all. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think it will.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jackson may receive some votes from Republicans. Last year, she received three \u201a\u00c4\u00ec from Graham, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u201a\u00c4\u00ec confirming her to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Graham preferred for Biden to choose Judge J. Michelle Childs from his home state and criticized the President for picking another Ivy League-educated nominee, claiming on Monday that Childs would\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve received \u201a\u00c4\u00fa60-plus\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 votes, including from himself. Jackson went to a public high school in Miami before earning both her undergraduate degree and law degree at Harvard University. Graham, like other Republicans, criticized Jackson for holding the support of left-wing groups. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re facing a choice sponsored by the most radical elements of the Democratic party when it comes to how to be a judge,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Graham said. Murkowski has said that her previous support of Jackson to be a judge does not signal how she would vote for Jackson to be a justice. But Collins has praised Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s credentials and experience as \u201a\u00c4\u00faimpressive.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Maine Republican said she would not make her decision until after the Judiciary Committee hearings.

The United Steelworkers union said in an email that the strike affecting the refinery in the city of Richmond, began at 12:01 a.m. It came after workers voted down Chevron\u2019s most recent contract offer and that Chevron refused to return to the bargaining table. BIDEN BLAMING HIGH GAS PRICES ON RUSSIA IS CYNICAL AND DISGRACEFUL Chevron said in a statement Sunday night that it has negotiated with the union for months and believes a contract offered by the company was fair and addressed union concerns. The company said that refinery operations will continue despite the strike and that it does not anticipate any supply chain issues. If the strike were to shut down the refinery, that could negatively affect gasoline prices in California \u2014 which has the highest regular gas price in the nation at $5.86 per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.

The eldest Biden grandchild, 28, and her fianc\u00e9, Peter Neal, 24, will celebrate at perhaps the most exclusive venue in the US. Ms Biden said she was \"endlessly grateful\" to her \"Nana and Pop\" for the honour. Four other wedding receptions have ever been held at the presidential home. Ms Biden, a graduate of Columbia Law School and the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, announced her engagement to Mr Neal, a law student at the University of Pennsylvania, in September. Ms Biden will only be the fifth bride to have a White House wedding reception, to be held in November. The previous one took place in 2008, when Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former president George W Bush, celebrated a month after she was wed in Texas. It has actually been more common to hold wedding ceremonies themselves at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - there have been 18 in total. Since the first White House wedding in 1812 - between the sister of First Lady Dolley Madison and Thomas Todd - most have involved close family members of the first couple. The wedding of Nellie Grant, daughter of President Ulysses S Grant, in May 1874, was seen as the most elaborate event ever held at the White House at the time. Two hundred and fifty guests gathered in the East Room, decorated with masses of white flowers and Nellie's white satin dress fell into a six-foot train. Still, like many weddings, it was also a stressful affair. Mr and Mrs Grant were said to be concerned about their 19-year-old daughter's wedding to Algernon Sartoris, a diplomat. One sitting president has said \"I do\" at the White House: President Grover Cleveland wed Frances Folson in the Blue Room in June 1886. Other recent White House weddings have included those of Lynda Bird Johnson - daughter of President Lyndon Johnson - who married Charles Spittal Robb in a grand event in the East Room in 1967. In 1971, Tricia Nixon - daughter of President Richard Nixon and Pat Nixon, was the first to hold a wedding in the White House Rose Garden. The latest White House wedding, in 2013, was one of just three not involving family of the president. Pete Souza, who was chief White House photographer under President Barack Obama, married fianc\u00e9e Pattie Lease in the Rose Garden.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

In a statement, the Academy said the 94th Oscars had been \"overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behaviour we saw Mr Smith exhibit on stage\". Smith has apologised for his actions and resigned from the Academy. The actor hit Rock for joking about his wife's shaved head, a result of the hair-loss condition alopecia. Less than an hour later, he was awarded the best actor award for his role in King Richard, where he played the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards ceremony, met virtually on Friday to discuss disciplinary action. In a statement, it said banning Smith was aimed at protecting performers and guests and \"restoring trust in the Academy\". The Academy said that directly after the slap it did not \"adequately address the situation in the room\" and had been \"unprepared for the unprecedented\". It apologised for this. It also thanked Rock for \"maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances\". In his resignation statement, Smith said he had \"betrayed the trust of the Academy\" and was \"heartbroken\" over his actions. He added he would \"fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct\". Smith's resignation means he will be unable to vote for future Oscars. The Academy's disciplinary review over the incident, originally scheduled for 18 April, was fast-tracked after he resigned. Few have ever stepped down from the Academy. Four members - producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Bill Cosby, director Roman Polanski and cinematographer Adam Kimmel - have been booted over sexual misconduct allegations, while actor Carmine Caridi was expelled in 2004 for pirating screener videos given to him. But the standards of conduct laid out by the film academy contained various disciplinary options for Smith, such as excluding him from future Oscars ceremonies, revoking his eligibility for awards or taking back his newly won Oscar. Only one Oscar has ever been taken back; a feature called Young Americans won the best documentary honour in 1969 but was found to be ineligible for the award that year. Late last month, actor Whoopi Goldberg - a member of the Academy's board of governors - predicted Smith would face \"big consequences\" but said \"we're not going to take that Oscar away from him.\" Beyond the Academy's actions, at least two studios - Sony and Netflix - are pausing their projects with Smith. Rock, who began his latest stand up comedy tour shortly after the Oscars telecast, has not commented publicly on the slap. He told fans at a show last month that he is \"still kind of processing what happened\" and will talk about the incident \"at some point\".

The ministers' annual meeting - known as the 2+2 Dialogue - was launched in 2018 to deepen co-operation between the two countries. The forum has focused on improving bilateral relations and co-operation in Asia. It is also seen as part of Washington's strategy to help India become a counterweight to China in the region. The two nations have largely been on the same page - at least in their public statements - on most issues of mutual concern. But it's not business as usual this time because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Delhi's press release ahead of the talks included the usual line about strengthening the \"comprehensive global strategic partnership\" between the two countries. But Washington's statement mentioned \"mitigating the destabilising impacts of Russia's war against Ukraine\", suggesting that the US will again nudge India - perhaps not too hard - to take a stronger position on Moscow. India and the US have had differing views over Ukraine since the war began in February. While Delhi has used strong words to comment on the invasion, it hasn't directly criticised Moscow. It has also abstained from all UN votes against Russia. India has also been trying to find ways to circumvent banking sanctions on Moscow to take advantage of discounted oil prices offered by Russian firms. India's stand of non-alignment also stems from its own geopolitical needs. Moscow is Delhi's time-tested ally and also its largest supplier of defence equipment - accounting for more than 50% of its imports. A former Indian diplomat said Delhi's stand has put Washington in a Catch-22 situation. The US wants India to be part of its wider strategy of isolating Russia but at the same time, it can't afford to weaken India against China - both diplomatically and militarily. Experts say this has created confusion in the White House about the best way to deal with India. Washington has not directly criticised India but has issued statements that experts call \"mild warnings\". After Mr Modi refrained from criticising Russia during a recent meeting of the Quad - which also includes Australia, the US and Japan - on Ukraine, Mr Biden said India's stand on the war was \"somewhat shaky\". His top economic adviser Brian Deese later said India had been informed that the consequences of a \"more explicit strategic alignment\" with Moscow would be \"significant and long-term\". But this didn't deter India as it once against abstained from the vote that suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Other US officials, including US Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics Daleep Singh, have appeared to be more understanding of India's stand. While Mr Biden and Mr Modi are likely to focus on bilateral ties, Ukraine still looms large over the meeting. It will also be on the agenda when Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh meet their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin on Monday. Both sides have been clear about their differing stands on Ukraine but there is too much at stake to risk their bilateral relationship. Washington sees India as an ally to challenge China's dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. Both countries also believe that there is massive untapped potential in bilateral trade. They have the ambitious target of taking bilateral trade - which was at $113bn in 2021 - to $500bn in the future. India also needs the US to help diversify its defence portfolio and reduce its reliance on Russian arms. Moscow continues to be India's largest arms supplier even though its share has dropped to 49% from 70%. The US was India's second-largest supplier between 2011 and 2015 after Russia, but fell behind France and Israel in the period between 2016 and 2021. Both Washington and Delhi would want to improve on these statistics. But the elephant in the room will continue to be India's purchase of the S-400 missile defence system from Russia -  a deal which gives India strategic deterrence against both China and Pakistan. The agreement has come under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), which was introduced in 2017 to target Russia, Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. It also prohibits any country from signing defence deals with these nations. The US had sanctioned China for buying the same system in 2018. But so far, it has been evasive about doing the same for India. It had refrained from sanctioning India even after the country started receiving the first deliveries of the S-400 in December last year. But the Ukraine war will now further complicate the situation. Some US officials have said in the past that there was no guarantee that India would get a waiver. Now, in the fast-changing geopolitical scenario, both Washington and Delhi would not want to publicly take stands against each other. But when the defence ministers meet, the S-400 and the issue of sanctions will definitely come up. How the two countries deal with this and their other differences will determine the future course of Washington-Delhi ties.

Philadelphia, known as the City of Brotherly Love, has had 96 homicides so far this year, falling one murder short of the notoriously violent Chicago three months into 2022. As of Monday, there had been 96 homicide victims in Philadelphia in 2022. According to Philadelphia Police Department statistics, that represented a 9% spike from the 88 homicide victims the city recorded at the same time last year. At the end of 2021, Philadelphia recorded a total of 562 homicide victims, compared to 499 in 2020 and 356 in 2019. WOMAN SHOT IN HEAD DIED; PHILLY HOMICIDES UP 11% YEAR TO YEAR: REPORT By comparison, Chicago has seen 97 homicide victims this year as of Monday, a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department, told Fox News Digital on Tuesday. From Jan. 1 through March 7, 2022, at 11:59 p.m. local time, Chicago police recorded 372 shooting incidents that impacted 432 victims, the spokesperson said by email. The gruesome statistic comes as Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw was expected to provide an update Tuesday afternoon following the deadly police shooting of 12-year-old Thomas Siderio, who investigators say first fired shots at approaching officers last week. The scene of a shooting of a 12-year-old girl, who was hospitalized in stable condition in February 2022, police said. (FOX29 Philadelphia WTXF) Amid the controversy, Philadelphia police officials sounded the alarm about what they described as an \"execution style murder\" early Tuesday in the city\u2019s Strawberry Mansion section. A man in his 20s sitting in a parked and running car on North 32nd Street was struck 15 times in his face, head and chest. Ballistic evidence showed over 30 shots were fired from two semi-automatic guns. No arrests were made. Over the weekend, three young men, ranging in age from 18 to 20, were all found shot to death either inside or lying beside a stolen vehicle Saturday evening in Philadelphia's West Oak Lane neighborhood. \"There\u2019s no fear of being caught carrying a gun illegally in the city of Philadelphia,\" Joe Sullivan, a retired Philadelphia police deputy commissioner, told Fox News Digital by phone Tuesday. \"It\u2019s the job of the police and the district attorney to create that perception of fear among bad guys that if you get caught with a gun, there will be swift and certain consequences.\" Sullivan argued that Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner\u2019s policies of not prosecuting or not fully prosecuting gun-related crime in Philadelphia have contributed to a drastic increase of violence. \"You\u2019re always going to have dysfunctionality when the police and the DA are not able to work independently of one another but cooperatively,\" Sullivan said. \"When it comes to violent crime, they need to be on the same page.\" District Attorney Larry Krasner addresses the media after a press conference announcing Danielle Outlaw as the new police commissioner on Dec. 30, 2019, in Philadelphia. (Mark Makela/Getty Images) As a progressive, Krasner has been advocating for criminal justice reform. But Sullivan said the district attorney just needs to hold a small group of repeat violent offenders accountable, meaning if an individual is a previously convicted felon, has a criminal record, or is caught with a gun while selling narcotics, prosecutors should follow the mandatory sentencing guidelines laid out by law. \"You can follow a timeline of the rise in homicide and the rise in violent crime and compare that to when the present DA took office, and you can see the relationship very easily. Without a doubt, the communities that are most impacted are communities of color \u2013 somewhere between 85 and 95% of all homicide victims in the city of Philadelphia are citizens of color,\" Sullivan said. \"What concerns me, whether you\u2019re a reformed DA or a conservative DA, if you have an increase of crime within your jurisdiction, you should be always be willing to take a second look at what you\u2019re doing,\" he said of Krasner. \"But he seems very unwilling to acknowledge that some of his policies have not had the intended consequences.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition to the district attorney, Sullivan also attributed the issue of violent crime to a lack of manpower and morale at the police department from the fallout of George Floyd\u2019s death. \"Like most police departments, Philadelphia is having a very hard time recruiting new applicants,\" Sullivan said. \"We\u2019ve seen a mass exodus of officers to early retirement and transferring laterally to other police departments, so the police department is severely understaffed right now, meaning there\u2019s also very little proactive policing going on.\" \"The lack of proactive policing is also driven by a perception that there\u2019s a lack of support for the police and a concern of if they get involved in any type of controversial incident how it\u2019s going to be handled by the administration and the district attorney,\" he said. \"You put all that together you have a recipe for disaster.\" Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

Despite a victory over the Denver Nuggets in his final game on Sunday, Vogel was unable to steer the squad into the postseason after the Lakers suffered eight consecutive defeats from March 24 to April 8. Rob Pelinka, the team\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vice president of basketball operations and General Manager, announced the decision via a news release. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have a tremendous amount of respect for Frank both on and off the court. Frank is a great coach and a good man. We will forever be grateful to him for his work in guiding us to the 2019-20 NBA championship. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is an incredibly difficult decision to make, but one we feel is necessary at this point.

When Lakers star forward LeBron James was asked about Vogel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s situation ahead of the team statement release, James said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI respect Frank as a coach, as a man.

Last season, Los Angeles lost to the eventual Western Conference champion, Phoenix Suns, in the first round of the playoffs. Vogel compiled an 127-98 regular season and 18-9 postseason record with the Lakers. Overall, the 48-year-old has a 431-389 regular season record, 48-39 in postseason in 11 seasons with the Lakers, Orlando Magic and Indiana Pacers. Vogel had signed a contract extension last year to keep him at the Lakers until 2023, but the team struggled this season, due in part to injuries. Star players LeBron James and Anthony Davis both spent time on the sidelines as a lack of consistency proved ultimately fatal for Vogel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reign.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal was \u201a\u00c4\u00fatenable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal is a tenable one.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was \u201a\u00c4\u00faultimately one for the Polish government,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces. The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe prospect of fighter jets \u201a\u00c4\u00f2at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either. US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so. Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday. Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s. Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine. A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere (she) ought to have heard about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nuland told lawmakers. The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faready to deploy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec immediately and free of charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said. Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country. By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in \u201a\u00c4\u00fainteragency\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 discussions to \u201a\u00c4\u00faexamine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine. Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland. Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized. The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn fact, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re handing over to the Ukrainians? We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in very active discussions with them about that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said Sunday. A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely. Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.

Source: Johns Hopkins University and national public health agencies Figures last updated: 5 July 2022, 08:59 BST The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available. Deaths are falling in many areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Data on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. Using this metric, researchers from the Lancet medical journal suggest that more than 18 million people may have died because of Covid up to the end of 2021. That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease. Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period. Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses. According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%. Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant. Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. Asia Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture. North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province. In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions. Europe Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic. In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. North America The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. Latin America Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously. Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June. Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people. Africa Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low. According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country. Middle East Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year. The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases. In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. Oceania Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus. Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths. In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years. Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies. When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult. Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic. The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Figures for France are for the mainland only and include both suspected and confirmed cases.

But the reassurances haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t eased his wife\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerns. She says the technology is often jarring and anxiety-inducing. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m reading, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s when I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Oh good grief,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sadie Krueger told CNN Business. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt would be jerky or swerve just out of the blue.

The technology drives like a \u201a\u00c4\u00fagrandpa\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in some cases, irritating nearby drivers, she says, but other times can be aggressive. Tesla enthusiasts with the unfinished, test version of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 currently a driver-assist system akin to an enhanced cruise control, are finding that family and friends like Krueger don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always share their enthusiasm. The technology promises to one day drive passengers to their destinations without human intervention. Many tell CNN Business that they use the software less when driving with other people, including their romantic partners. Passengers sometimes object to what they describe as the jerky driving style of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and have asked the Tesla fans not to use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in the vehicle. Some Tesla owners are preemptively deciding to not turn on \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 so that passengers get a smoother ride. Krueger said she humors her husband, as he gets a kick out of testing the software near their California home. His YouTube channel has more than 42,000 subscribers who watch his videos on Tesla. But she draws a line, too, and has asked him not to use it when she rides with him in cities or where he knows it is likely to be jerky. But plenty of passengers, especially younger ones like Krueger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s teenage son, and tech junkies, are excited by the nascent technology, and savor the experience, flaws and all. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s said that lives will be transformed with safer roads and affordable transportation. Musk has described Teslas as \u201a\u00c4\u00faappreciating assets\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that should be worth as much as $200,000, and claims they could someday bring in up to $30,000 in gross profit as robotaxis in the automaker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposed future ridehail network. In Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pitch, robotaxis would operate like Uber or Lyft vehicles that could be summoned via a Tesla smartphone app. There would be no human driver behind the wheel. There might not even be a steering wheel or pedals in the vehicle. Some Tesla enthusiasts have purchased their vehicles with plans to use them as robotaxis in the future. But before Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s technology can change the world, it will first have to work, and then it will have to win over fans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 loved ones. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the reactions of family and friends of its beta testers. Tesla first released an early version of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to a small group in October 2021. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t really \u201a\u00c4\u00faself-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the eyes of regulators and autonomous vehicle experts. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s more like an enhanced cruise control that steers, accelerates and navigates intersections, but it needs an attentive human driver behind the wheel who can take control at any moment because of the system\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shortcomings. Drivers reported being both amazed and alarmed by the system, which sometimes shines, and in other cases makes seemingly dangerous decisions. Tesla owner Justin Demaree says he tries to use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as much as possible. He views it as historically significant work. Tesla cars with \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 send driving data back to the automaker, which uses it to refine the software. Demaree imagines a day when people may not even fly anymore because self-driving software gets so good. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt will change everything,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Demaree said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to pay attention, you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to do anything, you can spend that time with family or doing other things that are more productive or add more value.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But Demaree must reckon with the difference between the promised future and the current reality when his family gets in the car. He only uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 about half the time that he drives with his wife Heather. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s being temperamental, she doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to ask anymore,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Demarre said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just turn it off.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Walt Corey, 70, hopes he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll never have to turn off the \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 software while driving alone or with his wife, Nancy. He bought a Tesla in hopes of ensuring their mobility and independence as they age. He says she gets annoyed with the loud alarm that sounds to alert drivers when they need to immediately take control of the car because it can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t handle a situation. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really obnoxious,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Corey said, explaining that the noise bothers him as well. \u201a\u00c4\u00faLet me know if I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m about to drive off the cliff or hit somebody, but don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do it because the software gets confused.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jeff Goin, a pilot and self-described \u201a\u00c4\u00fatechno-geek,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 bought a Tesla in part because he felt that Autopilot, its driver-assist technology that is more rudimentary than \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 would make him feel less fatigued after long drives. Tesla owners generally say that using Autopilot\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s auto-steering function on divided highways leaves them less drained after hours on the road. But Goin doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He tried the software and felt he was having to pay even more attention when using it.

Goin said he sometimes works in the car, so he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t like the distraction of being jostled. Even so, Goin says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s at times impressed with \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSometimes you get in there and you think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s come a long way. And then it stops on the railroad tracks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin said, describing a recent incident in which he says his Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 sensed a stop sign down the road and chose to stop earlier than advisable, briefly stopping on railroad tracks. Goin, who said he \u201a\u00c4\u00faimmensely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 admires CEO Elon Musk, is skeptical of how soon self-driving vehicles will be a reality. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time on the regular scale, minutes on a regular scale and then there are Musk minutes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin said. Though Musk has never wavered in his promise that self-driving Teslas are just around the corner, the challenge of building a fully autonomous vehicle has proven harder than those developing them expected. Building a robotaxi that drives safely isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough, either. Robotaxis will have to operate smoothly enough to make passengers like Goin comfortable. Many of them are unlikely to accept as many flaws as early adopters of technology. John Gibbs, a Georgia professor who says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s long tested beta software, is \u201a\u00c4\u00faused to seeing things break and behave weirdly and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Oh wow, I wonder what caused that,?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut there are people whose personality types are much less that. They just want something to work.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 One of them is Gibbs\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wife, Lane, he said, who doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t like it when full self-driving is jerky in turns. He uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with her on straightaways, but he turns it off at intersections where the car must turn. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFor her comfort and sanity, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve just learned it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not worth having her go, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Why are you doing this?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The leading Democrat is asymptomatic, her spokesman said on Thursday. Mrs Pelosi, 82, was seen hugging former President Barack Obama during his visit to the White House on Tuesday and standing close to President Joe Biden. According to the latest US guidelines, quarantine is not required after Covid-19 exposure for those vaccinated. Both Mr Biden and Mr Obama have been vaccinated, and the current president tested negative on Wednesday, the White House said. He is not considered a close contact under the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Mrs Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill said: \"The Speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, and is thankful for the robust protection the vaccine has provided\". \"The Speaker will quarantine consistent with CDC guidance, and encourages everyone to get vaccinated, boosted and test regularly\". The news of Mrs Pelosi's diagnosis comes as the US approaches 1 million Covid-19 related deaths since the start of the pandemic. After a steep spike in infections in December - fuelled by the highly contagious Omicron variant - Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions have fallen precipitously since mid-January. But breakthrough infections have hit a number of high-powered Washington residents in recent days, with vaccinated leaders including Attorney General Merrick Garland, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and US Congressman Adam Schiff announcing they had tested positive.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}
