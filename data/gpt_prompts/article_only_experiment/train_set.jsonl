Centrist Macron and Le Pen, a long-time standard-bearer for the French far-right, were the top two candidates in the first round of Sunday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote, picking up 27.8% and 23.2% of the ballots respectively, according to the French Interior Ministry. Twelve candidates ran for the top job. Since none of them received more than 50% of the ballots in the first round, the top two candidates will face each other in a runoff on April 24. The first round of the 2022 contest was marked by voter apathy, with participation estimated at 73.3%, according to an analysis by pollster Ifop-Fiducial for French broadcasters TF1 and LCI \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the lowest in a first round in 20 years. While Macron received more votes than any of the other candidates in the first round, he is a polarizing figure whose approval rating has sagged during his first term. In a speech after polls closed on Sunday, he urged citizens to vote in the second round. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNothing is settled and the debate that we will have in the coming 15 days is decisive for our country and our Europe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want a France which, having left Europe, would have as its only allies the international populists and xenophobes. That is not us. I want a France faithful to humanism, to the spirit of enlightenment,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Macron is seeking to become the first French president to win reelection since Jacques Chirac in 2002. Polls have given him a consistent edge over the rest of the field, but the race has tightened significantly in the past month. Polling by Ifop-Fiducial released on Sunday showed that Macron would win a second-round contest against Le Pen by just 51% to 49%. Le Pen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s support has steadily risen in recent weeks. Though she is best known for her far-right policies such as drastically restricting immigration and banning Muslim headscarves in public places, she has run a more mainstream campaign this time around, softening her language and focusing more on pocketbook issues like the rising cost of living, a top concern for the French electorate. In her speech Sunday, Le Pen vowed to be a president for \u201a\u00c4\u00faall the French\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if she wins the second round, and called on those who didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t vote for Macron to support her in the second round. Leftist firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon came third, with 22% of the vote. He enjoyed a late surge in support and was considered a possible dark horse candidate to challenge Macron. Who Melenchon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voters choose to back in the second round could decide the presidency, experts say. Melenchon told his supporters that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe must not give a single vote to Mrs. Le Pen,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but did not explicitly back Macron. No other candidate received more than 10% of the votes. Far-right political commentator turned presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, who enjoyed a seat among the top three candidates until March, according to Ifop polling, came in fourth at 7.1%. The other candidates on Sunday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ballot have quickly begun throwing their weight behind the top two. While Zemmour called on his backers to vote for Le Pen, the others urged their supporters to steer clear of her. The candidates from the traditional center-left and center-right parties, the Socialists and the Republicans, have already backed Macron. Socialist Anne Hidalgo said a Le Pen victory would instill in France \u201a\u00c4\u00faa hatred of everyone set against everyone,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while Republican Valerie Pecresse said she was sincerely worried for the country because \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe far right has never been so close to winning.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe project of Marine Le Pen will open France to discord, impotence, and collapse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Pecresse. Macron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s political rise shattered the playing field, as his centrist political party has pulled supporters away from the traditional centrist parties, the Socialists and the Republicans. Both its candidates polled under 5% on Sunday. Surveys ahead of the race showed that a second round of Macron vs. Le Pen was the most likely outcome. Macron handily beat Le Pen five years ago, but experts have said that a second contest between the two would be much tighter than the 2017 race. Macron is no longer a political upstart and must run on a mixed record. While his ambitious plan to bolster the European Union\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s autonomy and geopolitical heft won him respect abroad and at home, he remains a divisive figure when it comes to domestic policies. His handling of the yellow vest movement, one of France\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most prolonged protests in decades, was widely panned, and his record on the Covid-19 pandemic is inconclusive. Macron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signature policy during the crisis \u201a\u00c4\u00ec requiring people to show proof of vaccination to go about their lives as normal \u201a\u00c4\u00ec helped increase vaccination rates but fired up a vocal minority against his presidency. Macron has, so far, done very little campaigning. Experts believe his strategy was to avoid the political mudslinging as long as possible to brandish his image as the most presidential of all the candidates. Polling showed him consistently leading all candidates, and he was considered a shoo-in to make the second round. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe widespread dissatisfaction with Macron (especially among the young) means that the outcome is uncertain and unpredictable. Le Pen will continue to exploit this, and a major political upset therefore remains possible,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said CNN European affairs commentator Dominic Thomas of the second round matchup. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHowever much they may dislike Le Pen, there is a world of difference between her and Macron, and how she would disrupt European and global politics.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Le Pen is the daughter of another famous far-right presidential candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen. The elder Le Pen made it to the runoff against Jacques Chirac in 2002, but Marine Le Pen has managed to perform better than her father in the first round of each of the past two presidential elections. Le Pen has tried to portray herself as a very different candidate to the one who lost to Macron in 2017, when she attempted to position herself to the forgotten French working classes as her country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s answer to then-US President Donald Trump. While her economic nationalist stance, views on immigration, euroskepticism and positions on Islam in France are unchanged, Le Pen has sought to broaden her appeal. The contest was at first predicted to be a referendum on the dominance of the extreme right in French politics, but the war in Ukraine \u201a\u00c4\u00ec another key issue for voters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec upended the race. According to Ifop polling, Macron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s support peaked in early March, as potential voters rallied around the flag and rewarded the president for his attempts to mediate the conflict in Ukraine before Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion, even if it was a failure. Many experts also expected the war to hurt the Le Pen, who had been a vocal admirer of Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader who has become a pariah in the West due to the Kremlin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to invade Ukraine in late February. Le Pen visited the Russian president during her 2017 campaign; this time around, she was forced to scrap a leaflet with a photo of her and Putin from that trip after Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unprovoked attack on its neighbor. Thomas, the CNN European affairs commentator, explained that the forthcoming debates will be crucial if Macron is to convince voters that Le Pen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s previous support for Putin should disqualify her. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe will be vulnerable on a range of domestic issues, but she will have difficulty convincing the electorate of her foreign policy credentials, especially given her longstanding links with Russia,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Wake Forest University Medical School is standing by a student who suggested she intentionally harmed one of her patients for disagreeing with her about transgender ideology. The student, fourth-year Kychelle Del Rosario, came under fire after appearing to boast about the incident on Twitter in late March. The university responded with a brief suspension but announced no further consequences in its latest statement. Del Rosario tweeted: \"I had a patient I was doing a blood draw on see my pronoun pin and loudly laugh to the staff \u2018She/Her? Well of course it is! What other pronouns even are there?\u2019 I missed his vein so he had to get stuck twice.\" The university publicly responded to the incident in a statement on Wednesday, saying Del Rosario's tweet was not an accurate recounting of the incident. \"Our documentation verifies that after the student physician was unsuccessful in obtaining the blood draw, the student appropriately deferred a second attempt to one of our certified professionals. The student did not attempt to draw blood again,\" the school wrote. ETHICS PROFESSOR SLAMS MEDICAL STUDENT WHO IMPLIED SHE STUCK A PATIENT FOR MOCKING HER PRONOUN PIN The university's statement included a lengthy apology letter from Del Rosario, in which she claims she never intended to harm the individual, blaming the missed vein on inexperience. \"For the event mentioned in the tweet, I was performing a blood draw on a patient and during our conversation they had shown dismay at my pronoun pin,\" Del Rosario wrote, according to the university newspaper. \"I calmly shared my thoughts about pronouns and did not escalate the situation further. When I was doing the blood draw, I missed the first time due to my inexperience as a student, and per our policy, my supervisor performed the successful blood draw the second time. During this encounter, I never intended to harm the patient.\" \"I am truly sorry for poorly representing our school and our health system. I will reflect on responsible social media use as a professional and my duty to care for all my patients, regardless of any differences of belief,\" she concluded.

One op-ed published in the school's newspaper was titled \"Criticism of Wake Forest medical student is excessive.\" \"The crux of the issue at hand is not the conduct of Del Rosario, but the bigotry expressed by her patient,\" claimed the author, opinions editor and sophomore Sophie Guymon. \"It is appalling that the vast majority of the media coverage surrounding Del Rosario\u2019s tweet is critiquing her lack of professionalism rather than her patient\u2019s display of bigotry.\" Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

In a statement, the Academy said the 94th Oscars had been \"overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behaviour we saw Mr Smith exhibit on stage\". Smith has apologised for his actions and resigned from the Academy. The actor hit Rock for joking about his wife's shaved head, a result of the hair-loss condition alopecia. Less than an hour later, he was awarded the best actor award for his role in King Richard, where he played the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards ceremony, met virtually on Friday to discuss disciplinary action. In a statement, it said banning Smith was aimed at protecting performers and guests and \"restoring trust in the Academy\". The Academy said that directly after the slap it did not \"adequately address the situation in the room\" and had been \"unprepared for the unprecedented\". It apologised for this. It also thanked Rock for \"maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances\". In his resignation statement, Smith said he had \"betrayed the trust of the Academy\" and was \"heartbroken\" over his actions. He added he would \"fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct\". Smith's resignation means he will be unable to vote for future Oscars. The Academy's disciplinary review over the incident, originally scheduled for 18 April, was fast-tracked after he resigned. Few have ever stepped down from the Academy. Four members - producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Bill Cosby, director Roman Polanski and cinematographer Adam Kimmel - have been booted over sexual misconduct allegations, while actor Carmine Caridi was expelled in 2004 for pirating screener videos given to him. But the standards of conduct laid out by the film academy contained various disciplinary options for Smith, such as excluding him from future Oscars ceremonies, revoking his eligibility for awards or taking back his newly won Oscar. Only one Oscar has ever been taken back; a feature called Young Americans won the best documentary honour in 1969 but was found to be ineligible for the award that year. Late last month, actor Whoopi Goldberg - a member of the Academy's board of governors - predicted Smith would face \"big consequences\" but said \"we're not going to take that Oscar away from him.\" Beyond the Academy's actions, at least two studios - Sony and Netflix - are pausing their projects with Smith. Rock, who began his latest stand up comedy tour shortly after the Oscars telecast, has not commented publicly on the slap. He told fans at a show last month that he is \"still kind of processing what happened\" and will talk about the incident \"at some point\".

Ghost guns are one of many issues facing regulators and policymakers looking to address a spike in gun violence that began in early summer 2020. Gun homicides drove the uptick. Here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what you should know about ghost guns: Ghost guns are untraceable, self-assembled firearms, often put together with parts sold online, sometimes in as little as 30 minutes. Growing ghost gun problem adds to America's violence woes The weapons, sometimes referred to by officials as \u201a\u00c4\u00faprivately made firearms,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or PMFs, do not have serial numbers, making them all the more difficult to track and regulate. Purchasing kits to build ghost guns online does not require a background check, so buyers can sidestep the typical requirements that might come with buying a firearm. This means anyone \u201a\u00c4\u00ec no matter their age or criminal record \u201a\u00c4\u00ec can buy the kits and assemble a weapon. Calls for something to be done about ghost guns have grown as their use in shootings across the US has proliferated, with the weapons recovered at crime scenes in some big cities more frequently. While ghost guns make up a relatively small percentage of the total number of guns recovered by law enforcement, officials in several cities have reported sharp increases in those tallies, a CNN analysis of 2021 data found. In San Francisco, for example, about 20% of the nearly 1,100 guns it seized in 2021 were ghost guns, police there told CNN. And New York is on pace to again shatter the previous year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total, according to data shared with CNN. Since the start of this year, the NYPD has recovered 163 ghost guns, compared to 29 over the same period in 2021, mayor Eric Adams said Monday. In 2021, New York authorities seized 4,497 firearms \u201a\u00c4\u00ec  375, or 8.33%, were ghost guns. Of the 12,088 guns recovered in Chicago last year, 455, or 3.76%, were ghost guns, according to data from the city, up from 130 ghost guns recovered in 2020, when ghost guns made up 1.15% of the 11,343 guns recovered. Between 2016 and 2021, the ATF received 45,000 reports of privately made firearms recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations, including 20,000 reported last year alone. The agency was able to trace only 1% of the 45,000, officials said, because the firearms lack serial numbers. The number of guns the ATF traced rose from about 217,000 in 2015 to just over 393,000 in 2020. Just this past week, a ghost gun was recovered outside the home of a suspect arrested for the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old girl in the South Bronx, a police source told CNN. The regulation the Biden administration announced Monday addresses a gap in the government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to track ghost guns, requiring background checks before kit purchases and inclusion of serial numbers on some pieces used to assemble weapons. Biden to announce new gun regulation and name ATF nominee \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Biden administration is making sure these kits are treated as the deadly firearms they are,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 a senior administration official said ahead of the announcement. The new rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check, which is required for other kinds of firearm purchases. Those selling kits will also be required to include a serial number on the components that make up the weapon, so the eventual firearm can be traced. Additionally, the new rules mandate firearm dealers add a serial number to already-assembled ghost guns they come across. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no longer a ghost,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said in the Rose Garden on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt has a return address. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to help save lives, reduce crime and get more criminals off the streets.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN Political Briefing Podcast: Biden tackles gun violence At least 10 states and Washington, DC, have already taken steps to restrict or ban the purchase or use of ghost guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Maryland was the latest to join last week, when the governor allowed legislation to pass that altered the definition of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafirearm\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to include an unfinished frame or receiver and prohibiting the sale of such components, among other steps. Maryland joins 10 states and DC becoming latest to place restrictions on ghost guns Republican Gov. Larry Hogan thanked the legislature for addressing untraceable firearms in a letter. But he said the legislation did not go far enough to hold accountable those who actually commit shootings. Last October, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed legislation last October aimed at tackling the epidemic of gun violence, including prohibiting \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe sale of ghost guns and requiring gunsmiths and dealers in firearms to register firearms in their possession,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. In the meantime, federal authorities have been cracking down on those who are either in possession of ghost guns or looking to traffic them. Four men were charged in Baltimore last month with conspiracy and dealing firearms \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including ghost guns \u201a\u00c4\u00ec without a license, per the US Attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office in Maryland. In January, a Rhode Island man was charged by the US Attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office of the Southern District of New York for allegedly selling or attempting to sell more than 100 guns he made at his home. According to the Justice Department, the 34-year-old allegedly purchased the parts, made them at his home in Providence, Rhode Island, and then sold the completed weapons. He was charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic firearms and one count of making false statements, the DOJ said in a news release.

Fredrick Norman \u2014known as \"Slowkey Fred\"\u2014 is accused of running the ring that\u2019s purchased hundreds of firearms from federally licensed firearm dealers across Georgia since 2020. The group then conspired to sell them without a license and transport them across state lines to Philadelphia, where federal authorities say the guns started showing up at crime scenes or in the possession of convicted felons.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal was \u201a\u00c4\u00fatenable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal is a tenable one.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was \u201a\u00c4\u00faultimately one for the Polish government,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces. The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe prospect of fighter jets \u201a\u00c4\u00f2at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kirby said. The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either. US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so. Poland\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday. Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s. Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine. A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere (she) ought to have heard about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nuland told lawmakers. The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faready to deploy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec immediately and free of charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said. Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country. By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in \u201a\u00c4\u00fainteragency\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 discussions to \u201a\u00c4\u00faexamine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine. Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland. Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized. The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn fact, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re handing over to the Ukrainians? We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in very active discussions with them about that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blinken said Sunday. A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely. Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.

Tanner Brass was found dead hours after police arrested his mother, Kyla Frenchman, when she argued with them about her son's safety, she said. The boy's father, Kaij Brass, has been charged with second-degree murder. Indigenous leaders say Ms Frenchman was racially profiled and have demanded the local police chief's resignation. Two Canadian police officers in the city of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, have been suspended. Police responded to reports of a domestic dispute in the early hours of 10 February and found Ms Frenchman standing outside the apartment building, she said. Ms Frenchman told the officers she had been kicked out of her apartment and feared her 13-month-old son was in danger. She said the officers told her to wait outside and entered the building, only to return shortly afterwards and say no-one had answered the door. Ms Frenchman said when she demanded the officers check on Tanner, she was arrested for suspected intoxication. She denies being drunk. Several hours later police were called back to the same home to reports of a homicide involving a child. They found Tanner dead and Kaij Brass was arrested. Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Kyla Frenchman struggled to speak as she demanded justice for her son. Standing with friends and relatives, she spoke of her son as a \"happy baby\" with a big smile. A statement read on her behalf said she had \"begged and pleaded\" with police to help her and her child after they arrived at their home. It went on: \"Instead, they accused me of being drunk. They put me in handcuffs and they put me in a cell.\" A statement from the Prince Albert police department described the boy's death as a tragedy. It added: \"As an organisation, there is nothing we can say to lessen the grief and torment at this shocking loss of a deeply loved child from our community.\" But Heather Bear, Vice-Chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, said: \"If these officers showed up to a domestic dispute call involving a young white family, knowing that an infant was inside and possibly in danger, do you think they would have arrested the mother and left?\" Police have not responded to this allegation. Earlier this month, the department's chief, Jon Bergen, suspended the two officers involved with pay. Last week, 95% of the union representing Prince Albert officers supported a vote of no confidence in Mr Bergen's leadership. Ms Frenchman said in her statement she believed Tanner would still be alive \"if they had listened to me\". An investigation into the boy's death is ongoing.

The state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Representatives also approved SB 184, which would make it a class C felony for medical professionals to provide gender-affirming care \u201a\u00c4\u00ec such as hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender-reassignment surgery \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to people 18 and younger. Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bills into law Friday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are very real challenges facing our young people, especially with today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s societal pressures and modern culture. I believe very strongly that if the Good Lord made you a boy, you are a boy, and if he made you a girl, you are a girl. We should especially protect our children from these radical, life-altering drugs and surgeries when they are at such a vulnerable stage in life. Instead, let us all focus on helping them to properly develop into the adults God intended them to be,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, according to a statement from her press office. Senate Bill 184 states medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care could face up to 10 years in prison. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe decision to pursue a course of hormonal and surgical interventions to address a discordance between the individual\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sex and sense of identity should not be presented to or determined for minors who are incapable of comprehending the negative implications and life-course difficulties attending to these interventions,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the bill reads. Book bans move to center stage in the red-state education wars The legislation would also make it a violation for public or private school officials, such as teachers, principals, nurses and counselors to encourage a minor to withhold from their parent or guardian \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe fact that the minor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s perception of his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with the minor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sex.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The bill, dubbed the Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, passed the Republican-controlled House following a 66-28 vote, according to the state legislature\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s website. The GOP-led Senate passed the bill 24-6 in February, and it will become law 30 days after the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signature. Alabama would be the latest state to enact such a measure. Last year, Republican lawmakers in Arkansas overrode a veto from their governor to put their own health care ban on the books, and Tennessee and Arizona have passed similar bans. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued Arkansas over its ban last year, and in July, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the law. The ACLU, the ACLU of Alabama and other legal advocacy groups announced plans to file a legal challenge to the bill. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur representatives have been hearing from medical experts, parents, transgender youth, and other advocates for the past three years in an attempt to stop this harmful bill from passing. But despite this strong opposition, the Legislature seems determined to move ahead with this shameful effort to prevent parents and kids from deciding the best course of treatment for themselves,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Kaitlin Welborn, staff attorney for the ACLU of Alabama. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the state moves forward in passing this unconstitutional bill, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll see them in court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Later, the legislature passed a bill requiring K-12 students to use bathrooms designated for their biological sex. House Bill 322 also includes a late amendment banning classroom discussions or instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools. Kentucky's Democratic governor vetoes anti-trans sports ban An original version of the bill sought \u201a\u00c4\u00fato require public K-12 schools to designate the use of rooms where students may be in various stages of undress upon the basis of biological sex.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Just before the final vote Thursday afternoon, Republican state Sen. Shay Shelnutt introduced an amendment to \u201a\u00c4\u00faprohibit classroom instruction or discussion on sexual orientation or gender identity for students in kindergarten through the fifth grade.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shelnutt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s amendment also declares schools should not \u201a\u00c4\u00faengage in classroom discussion or provide classroom instruction regarding sexual orientation or gender identity in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The bill, including Shelnutt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s amendment, passed the state Senate in a 26-5 vote. After the bill was sent back to the House for a concurrence vote, the amendment was adopted Thursday night following a 70-26 vote. The bill now heads to Ivey for final approval, according to Julie Saint, supervisor for enrolling and engrossing for the Alabama House of Representatives. Opponents of the measure condemned its passage, with the ACLU of Alabama saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt also invokes legislation similar to Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s controversial \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 bill by banning classroom instruction or discussion of gender identity in public elementary schools.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The legislation violates the US Constitution and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, the ACLU said. The Human Rights Campaign issued a statement Thursday night, \u201a\u00c4\u00fatransgender students will bear the cost of the discrimination \u201a\u00c4\u00ec discrimination which already causes transgender youth to feel unsafe in school, suffer academically, and have a higher likelihood of dropping out of school.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The governor said signing the bill was a \u201a\u00c4\u00fano-brainer.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faLet me be clear to the media and opponents who like to incorrectly dub this the \u201a\u00c4\u00faDon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t Say Gay\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 amendment: That is misleading, false and just plain wrong,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ivery said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t need to be teaching young children about sex.

Earlier this week, a ProPublica report revealed Mr Thomas failed to disclose trips he took with real estate mogul Harlan Crow almost every year over the course of two decades, despite being required to file annual disclosures of gifts. In a statement on Friday, Mr Thomas said that he had been told by colleagues and others that \"this sort of personal hospitality\" did not need to be formally disclosed. Mr Thomas is one of nine justices on the Supreme Court serving lifetime appointments after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. Here is a look at the conservative justice and his eight colleagues who sit on the bench, including the Supreme Court's most recent member, Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal chosen by President Joe Biden last year. Jackson's appointment has not altered the 6-3 conservative majority on the court. On the court since: 23 October 1991 How he got to the court: Thomas was born in a small town in Georgia, and was one of the few African-Americans in attendance during a short stint in seminary and then at Holy Cross College. But unlike Justice Sotomayor, those experiences made him distrustful of affirmative action policies. After finishing Yale Law, he worked in Missouri government and in Washington DC before being named chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency that responds to discrimination claims in the workplace. After a bruising confirmation hearing - in which a former employee accused him of sexual harassment - Thomas was narrowly confirmed to Supreme Court, at the relatively young age of 43. Who is he as a justice? Thomas' originalism is exacting, including a disregard for stare decisis, respect for prior court rulings and precedence. Thomas has also not asked a question during oral arguments in nine years. He has previously said he doesn't care for the question-heavy arguments, sometimes already drafting opinions based on written briefs before any lawyer gets up to argue. Thomas often files entirely separate dissents rarely joined by others, but Coyle says he is influential in other ways, including during conferences only justices attend, and in \"difficult decisions\" in areas that don't get a lot of press - like intellectual property and tax law. Thomas replaced the first African-American justice on the court - Thurgood Marshall. On the court since: 3 October 2022 How she got to the court: The first black woman to sit on the court in its 233-year history is also the first justice since 1967 to come to the court with extensive experience as a criminal defence attorney. Before the US Supreme Court, the Washington DC native served on the influential US court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. Ms Jackson has said she has a \"methodology\" to deciding cases but not an overarching philosophy.\u00a0Some conservatives have accused her of being \"soft\" on criminals, pointing to her experience as a public defender and willingness as a federal judge to issue prison sentences below federal guidelines. Her confirmation came after President Biden pledged during his presidential campaign to appoint a black woman to the top court. On the court since: 31 January 2006 How he got to the court: Alito grew up in New Jersey in an Italian immigrant family. While at Princeton University, he was involved in conservative and libertarian groups, as well as the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps. After Yale law school, he was a prosecutor in New Jersey and served in the Reagan administration in the justice department, including as assistant to the solicitor general, where he argued before the Supreme Court. President George HW Bush named him to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1990, where he stayed until his nomination to The Supreme Court. Who is he as a justice? Alito is a conservative justice, but one who does not hew as often to originalism as fellow conservatives Scalia and Thomas. He is not always talkative in oral arguments  but his questions are sharp, aiming to pick apart an argument's logic. Alito has a low public profile despite being a large part of the court's rightward shift on business, campaign finance and racial issues over the past decade. The former prosecutor has been \"very pro-government\" in criminal cases, Coyle says, and has shown less willingness than his conservative colleagues to protect free speech in cases where it is harmful or hateful. On the court since: 7 August 2010 How she got to the court: Kagan grew up in New York City. At the age of 12, she convinced her rabbi to hold the synagogue's first formal bat mitzvah, the rite of passage for young women. After law school at Harvard, she clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. After a successful stint as the first female dean of Harvard Law School, she was briefly US solicitor general - the federal government's top representative at the US Supreme Court, before being nominated by President Barack Obama for the high court. Who is she as a justice? Kagan is the first justice in decades not to previously serve as a judge. She is part of the court's left-leaning wing, but has been the author of many of recent unanimous or near unanimous decisions. Her writing is often easy for a layperson to understand without sacrificing legal analysis, and she is an aggressive questioner during oral arguments. Kagan first took her seat at the bench at the age of 50 and could potentially be a force on the court for decades. Lithwick says Kagan is \"much more inscrutable\" on issues than other recent additions to the court. \"She's very close to the vest,\" she says. On the court since: 29 September 2005 How he got to the court: Born in New York and raised in Indiana, Roberts attended a boarding school as a teenager but also spent summers working in a steel mill. After considering becoming a historian at Harvard, he went to law school there instead, eventually clerking for then-Associate Justice Rehnquist. He spent many years as a lawyer in the Reagan administration then entered private practice, arguing before the high court and serving as one of several legal advisers to George W Bush in the Florida presidential recount case. Originally nominated to fill the spot left by retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Roberts was re-nominated for the chief justice position after Chief Justice Rehnquist died between terms, and his nomination was fast-tracked. Who is he as a justice: A conservative justice, Roberts is the third-youngest Chief Justice in the court's history, confirmed at 50 years old. Last year's term saw more than half its cases decided unanimously, something many court watchers cite as the outcome of Roberts' desire to foster agreement through narrower rulings. He also notably wrote the 5-4 opinion that shot down a major challenge to President Barack Obama's healthcare law. \"I think he cares deeply about how the 'Roberts court' looks,\" Lithwick says, and knows he can move the court slowly over decades. \"He doesn't want huge swings, except in areas he feels very strongly about,\" Coyle says, like government's role in racial issues, campaign finance's relation to free speech and the structure of constitution. Roberts also looks to keep decorum on the bench during oral arguments. On the court since: 8 August 2009 How she got to the court: Sotomayor was born to Puerto Rican parents in the Bronx. As a student at Princeton University, she fought for hiring more Latino professors and admitting more Latino students. After Yale Law school, she became a prosecutor in New York and was later named to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal appeals courts are often the final step before the Supreme Court for cases. In the second circuit, Sotomayor authored more than 150 majority opinions - including a few that were ultimately overruled by the higher court. Who is she as a justice? Sotomayor is the first Hispanic justice. She's also been one of the most public facing - her memoir appeared on the New York Times' best-selling list, she appeared twice on Sesame Street, once to adjudicate a dispute between Goldilocks and Baby Bear, and she helped drop the ball in Times Square on New Year's Eve 2013.  \"She's trying really hard to demystify the court, showing 'You can be a justice too',\" Lithwick says. Her former experience as a prosecutor and trial judge often leads her to challenge lawyers on the facts of a case, says Marcia Coyle, the chief Washington correspondent for the National Law Journal. \"She knows how criminal trials operate,\" Coyle says. On the court since: 10 April 2017 How he got to the court: At 49, Gorsuch was the youngest nominee in a quarter of a century when he was approved in 2017. The Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. He began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, and worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Who is he as a justice? Gorsuch succeeded the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and was welcomed by conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law. In his first year on the court he has cemented the 5-4 conservative advantage, and that's been seen in a series of rulings on contentious issues such as the Trump travel ban, trade union fees and gerrymandering. On the court since: 6 October 2018 How he got to the court: Kavanaugh served on the influential Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit and was formerly a White House aide under George W Bush. He previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. His confirmation process was one of the most controversial in recent years amid allegations of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, which he denied. After a hearing in which one of his accusers gave a dramatic testimony of the alleged incident and Kavanaugh fiercely defended his record, he was approved by the Senate by 50-48. Born in Washington, DC in 1965, Kavanaugh studied at Georgetown Preparatory School an all-boys school in Bethesda, Maryland, and graduated from Yale College and Yale Law School. Who is he as a justice? He succeeded Anthony Kennedy, who was the Supreme Court's swing vote, often casting the deciding opinion in 5-4 cases, consolidating a conservative majority at the top court. Some Democrats fiercely opposed to his name for his views on delicate issues such as abortion. His views on the environment and gun rights have also raised concerns among environmentalists and gun control activists. On the court since: 27 October 2020 How she got to the court: Born in New Orleans of Irish and French ancestry, Barrett was the eldest of seven children in a devoutly Catholic family and is now herself a mother of seven. She was the student body vice-president at her all-girls Catholic high school. After graduating first in her class at Notre Dame Law School, in Indiana, she clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, and later worked on George W Bush's election lawsuit in 2000. Barrett also became a distinguished law professor at her alma mater. She was picked for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 by President Donald Trump and was nominated to the high court less than three years later. Who is she as a justice? Often considered a protege of Justice Scalia, Barrett is a proponent of textualism, the view that judges should apply the law as written and interpret the US Constitution as it was originally intended. In her acceptance speech at the White House, Barrett said: \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\" She has said her Catholic faith does not influence her rulings. Past legal opinions and remarks on abortion and gay marriage have made her popular with the religious right, but have earned her vehement opposition from the left. She drew scrutiny for her reported leadership role, with the title of \"handmaid\", in the People of Praise, a tight-knit, Christian faith-based group.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-not-biased"}]}

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will publicly announce the determination, which human rights groups have been advocating for years, at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, on Monday. Reuters first reported on the administration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recognition of genocide. Until now, the US had stopped short of declaring the atrocities \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including mass killings and rape \u201a\u00c4\u00ec committed in 2017 against the Muslim minority Rohingya population a genocide. The violence forced nearly a million people to flee, and the United Nations recommended that top military officials face genocide charges. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI applaud the Biden administration for finally recognizing the atrocities committed against the Rohingya as genocide.

US Marshals found and arrested 28-year-old Jacob Greer in Spanaway, Washington, on Monday. He had been on the run since 2016, authorities said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe arrest of Jacob Greer after six years is a testament to the tenacity of Deputy US Marshals and our investigative partners,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ted Kamatchus, US Marshal for the Southern District of Iowa, said in the Tuesday statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faEven though the case went cold, they would not quit,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kamatchus said. Greer is currently at the Federal Detention Center in Seattle and will be transported to Des Moines to stand trial, accoring to the statement. He will be assigned counsel when he returns to Iowa, the Iowa public defender\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office said. Greer was initially arrested in April 2016 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on charges of alleged receipt and possession of child pornography. He was released on bond the next day under pretrial supervision with an ankle monitor. He was living with his grandmother in Des Moines at the time. On May 31, 2016, Greer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s probation officer was alerted that Greer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ankle monitor had been removed, resulting in a multiagency search effort, the US Marshals statement said. Authorities found Greer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s car with a suicide note inside, but searchers never found his body and a federal arrest warrant for Greer was issued. Investigators later discovered another vehicle associated with Greer at a campground in Flathead, Montana, which he had purchased with a $1,000 loan from a friend, the statement said. The US Marshals Service said Greer was last seen at a Walmart in Kalispell, Montana, in June 2016, wearing a camouflage hat. Greer had allegedly fled Iowa with money, a bow, arrows and a backpack full of survival gear and \u201a\u00c4\u00fahad plans to live off the land in remote areas of the upper western states or southern Canada, hiding out in abandoned cabins,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement said.

Chuck Grassley. Finkenauer pledged Monday to \u201a\u00c4\u00fachallenge this deeply partisan decision to the Iowa Supreme Court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Sunday night, Polk County District Judge Scott Beattie ruled that Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name \u201a\u00c4\u00fashall not be included on the primary ballot for the Democratic Primary for U.S. Senate.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The ruling centers around a dispute over the signatures required to get on the ballot. Although Finkenaur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign submitted more than the necessary 3,500 signatures, the judge found that she did not meet the requirement that each candidate have at least 100 signatures from at least 19 Iowa counties due to questions about three signatures obtained from Allamakee and Cedar counties. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Court takes no joy in this conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beattie wrote. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis Court should not be in the position to make a difference in an election, and Ms. Finkenauer and her supporters should have a chance to advance her candidacy. However, this Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s job is to sit as a referee and apply the law without passion or prejudice. It is required to rule without consideration of the politics of the day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finkenauer initially responded to the decision by saying her campaign was \u201a\u00c4\u00faexploring all of our options to fight back hard.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Later on Monday, Finkenauer announced she would challenge the decision with the Iowa Supreme Court. Finkenauer lawyer asks Iowa Supreme Court to return her to primary ballot in fight over signatures \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe refuse to back down in the face of these partisan attacks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are confident that we have met every requirement to be on the ballot, and we will not stop fighting back against this meritless attack that seeks to silence the voices of tens of thousands of Iowans.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Although Finkenauer has blamed Republicans for her signature issues, Democratic operatives in Iowa have been quietly aghast at how a statewide candidate, let alone someone who successfully ran for Congress recently, cut it so close on the signatures needed to make the ballot. The success of Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge will now rest with seven justices on Iowa\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00ec only one of whom was appointed by a Democrat. If Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s challenge is unsuccessful, the former congresswoman could accept the ruling and run as a write-in candidate in the June primary. This could be complicated by the fact that although Finkenauer, a former congresswoman, was the front-runner in the Democratic field, she is running against two other Democrats: Glenn Hurst, a city council member in Minden, Iowa, and Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral. Republicans have been challenging Finkenauer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signatures, initially bringing the complaint to the State Objections Panel. The state body decided in March that Finkenauer could stay on the ballot, but just narrowly. The panel found that Finkenauer submitted at least 100 signatures from 20 counties and needed 19. One of those counties was knocked out by the objection but she was able to squeak by with 100 signatures in one challenged county and 101 in two others. But Republicans successfully brought this lawsuit, saying the panel incorrectly interpreted the law.

Three Republicans crossed the aisle to seal her appointment by a vote of 53 to 47. Justice Jackson's appointment fulfils President Joe Biden's campaign promise to put a black woman on the court. Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, called it a \"joyous day\" for the US. The vote was overseen by Vice-President Kamala Harris, the first black woman to hold the office. Ms Jackson, 51, will replace Justice Stephen Breyer, a fellow liberal judge for whom she once clerked, upon his retirement in June. The lifetime appointment will likely see Ms Jackson on the bench for decades, but will not shift the ideological balance of the current court, with its 6-3 conservative majority. Ms Jackson has said she has a \"methodology\" to deciding cases but not an overarching philosophy. And she agreed with Republican senators about the importance of abiding by the text of the Constitution, as it was intended by the founders. During her confirmation, Democrats touted her experience working as a public defender. She will be the first Supreme Court justice since Thurgood Marshall - the first black Supreme Court justice -  to have career experience representing criminal defendants. The jurist, a Washington DC native, currently sits on the influential US court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. She worked as a public defender in Washington before joining a private practice prior to her judicial appointments. Some Republicans took issue with clients Ms Jackson took on as a public defence lawyer - namely terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, with some accusing her of being soft on crime. Others, however, applauded the diversity of experience her legal career would bring to the bench over the course of what was at times highly fractious and almost entirely polarised six week confirmation process. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of three Republicans to vote in favour of Justice Jackson said this decision rested, in part, as a \"rejection of the corrosive politicisation\" that has come to shape the confirmation process. The new justice \"will bring to the Supreme Court a range of experience from the courtroom that few can match given her background in litigation,\" Ms Murkowski said. The top court plays a crucial role in American public life and is often the last word on highly contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government. Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation is a historic one as the appointment of the first black female justice. It's also notable because her professional background differs markedly from recent justices. She is the first since Thurgood Marshall in 1967 to come to the court with extensive experience as a criminal defence attorney. A recent Cato Institute study found that throughout the federal court system, former prosecutors outnumber defence attorneys by four to one. Some conservatives have accused Ms Jackson of being \"soft\" on criminals, pointing to her experience as a public defender and willingness as a federal judge to issue prison sentences below federal guidelines. While her supporters vociferously dispute this, Ms Jackson is likely to bring a different perspective to the court, particularly on the criminal procedure cases that regularly appear on the docket. As one of nine justices, replacing one of only three liberals on the court, her arrival may have a negligible impact on the court rulings. She has a lifetime appointment to assert her influence, however. And even if she's not penning majority rulings, that influence can come through private interactions with justices and through dissenting opinions that could preview new legal principles if the court's ideological balance someday shifts.

The measure comes as the country grapples with some of the worst housing affordability issues in the world. Prices have jumped more than 20%, pushing the average home in Canada to nearly C$817,000 ($650,000; \u00a3495,000) -  more than nine times household income. But industry analysts say it's not clear a ban on foreign buyers will address the problem. Data on purchases by foreign buyers in Canada is limited, but research suggests they amount for a small fraction of the market. \"I don't think\u00a0it's going to have a huge\u00a0impact,\" said Ben Myers, president of advisory firm Bullpenn Research & Consulting in Toronto, who found foreigners accounted for just 1% of purchases in 2020, down from 9% in 2015 and 2016. \"It's a fairly low number and let's face it, the people that really want to buy ... are going to find alternative ways to do it.\" Mr Myers said the soaring housing costs reflect strong population growth and a shortage of supply, due in part to rules that restrict development. The issues have worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers in Canada and elsewhere slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, lowering borrowing costs and boosting demand even further. The moves have fuelled the soaring housing prices seen in many markets around the world, but in Canada the disconnect between home prices and incomes is one of the most dramatic, according to OECD data. Mr Trudeau pledged to tackle housing affordability during his campaign for election last year. In addition to the temporary ban on foreign buyers, the budget proposal his government unveiled on Thursday sets aside billions to spur new construction and proposes new programmes, such as a tax-free savings account for first-time buyers. This video can not be played Why it takes 30 years to buy a house in Canada Mr Trudeau has also discussed banning certain bidding processes that favour investors, who by some measures have accounted for about one in five homes purchased in Canada since 2014. The proposed ban on foreign buyers would exempt permanent residents and foreign students and workers, as well as those buying their primary residence. The proposal builds on actions such as special taxes that some parts of Canada have already taken against out-of-town and foreign buyers. In Ontario, for example, provincial Premier Doug Ford recently announced plans to raise an existing tax on foreign buyers from 15% to 20% and expand it beyond Toronto to the entire province. While foreign purchases are not the driver of the affordability issues, taxing them at least captures revenue that can be re-deployed to address such problems, said Steve Pomeroy, head of Focus Consulting, a housing policy firm. \"If you ban them, you don't really have much of an impact on suppressing rising home prices and you give up the revenue,\" he said. New Zealand introduced a similar measure banning foreign buyers in 2018. \"It's good politics because it's easy to blame a victim that nobody cares about,\" Mr Pomeroy added. \"I don't think it will have much of an impact.\" Paul Kershaw, professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, also said he saw little in  Mr Trudeau's proposal likely to slow price increases or significantly address affordability. \"It's not clear the housing measures will be sufficient to break Canada's addiction to high and rising home prices,\" he said, noting that for existing homeowners, the high prices help amass wealth. Mr Pomeroy said he does expect price appreciation to slow in coming months, as the central bank raises interest rates. The Canadian housing market is particularly susceptible to such moves, since many buyers rely on five-year mortgages rather than the long-term ones common in the US and UK. But higher interest rates will only make it less affordable for prospective buyers trying to break into the market, he warned. Mr Myers said over the long-term, he expects hot markets such as Toronto and Vancouver to become dominated by renters, as regular buyers get priced out of the market, unless politicians address supply. But Mr Pomeroy said high development costs means that adding supply will not necessarily reduce prices, unless the additions are dramatic. \"Unless you've got born into the right family ... the prospects for young buyers are quite dim,\" he said.

One of the worshippers said the experience was \"terrifying\" and described hearing a scream before turning around to see a man holding an axe and using bear spray - similar to pepper spray - against three people. \"By the time he was spraying, the people in the first row realized something was going on and one of the young men turned around and knocked away the axe before he had a chance to use it,\" Noorani Sairally told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. The young man then held the alleged assailant down until police arrived, the witness said. \"Before he could inflict harm on any worshippers, several congregants bravely were able to stop him in his tracks,\" imam Ibrahim Hindy said in a statement, describing the moment the attacker entered the site. \"Our community will never be broken and we refuse to be intimidated,\" he added. Police have named the man they arrested as Mohammad Moiz Omar, and charged him with six offences including assault with a weapon and administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm. Following initial uncertainty over a possible motive, investigators now say they believe the attack was a \"hate-motivated incident.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of a number of high-profile Canadian public figures to condemn the attack, which he described as \"incredibly disturbing\" and applauded the courage of the worshippers at the mosque.

However, Mr Agrawal tweeted: \"Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.\" The Tesla boss remains Twitter's largest shareholder and the firm will remain open to his input, he added. Just over an hour after Mr Agrawal's announcement, Mr Musk cryptically tweeted a single emoji. The tweet has since been deleted. Allow Twitter content?

Over the weekend, the Tesla chief suggested changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price, banning advertising and giving the option to pay in the cryptocurrency dogecoin. Mr Musk also asked his more than 81 million followers whether Twitter is \"dying\" and if its headquarters should be turned into a homeless shelter. And he created a poll asking whether the letter \"w\" should be removed from the Twitter, with the only options being \"yes\" and \"of course\". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Agrawal said Twitter offered Mr Musk a seat on its board as the company had believed it was \"the best path forward\", with board members having to \"act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders\". However addressing Mr Musk's decision to decline, Mr Agrawal said: \"I believe this is for the best\". \"We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our board or not,\" he added. \"Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input.\" Laura Foll, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said: \"The statement from the Twitter chief executive is, I think, quite telling in that he says 'look, Elon decided not to join the board'. It says in the statement the board offered him a seat [and] it was Elon Musk's decision. \"But the Twitter chief executive goes on to say 'there will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged. Let's tune out the noise.' I think this is the Twitter chief executive saying 'we want to get on with running the business without these distractions'.\" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This is a very large publicly listed company. There are very strict rules around what board members, what executive members can say publicly. There has to be very strict controls and I think this is the Twitter chief executive just saying 'let's get on with it now, let's run this company and Elon Musk will be a shareholder and we will listen to him along with shareholders'.\" As the largest shareholder, Elon Musk has more than four times the 2.25% shareholding of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Shares in Twitter soared by more than 27% last Monday after Mr Musk's stake was revealed. However, many Twitter employees have felt disgruntled by the announcement. According to company insiders, there was anxiety over what impact he would have on the social media company's ability to moderate content in the future. Twitter's chief executive started his statement with a cryptic line. \"Here's what I can share\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" Clearly a lot has gone on behind the scenes that he has left out. The announcement of Elon Musk's appointment to Twitter's board appeared to please everyone. Mr Musk seemed happy, Parag Agrawal tweeted out his approval, as did Twitter's former boss Jack Dorsey. The deal made sense for Twitter. Crucially, in exchange for a board seat, Mr Musk agreed not to buy more than 14.9% of the company. Mr Musk is so wealthy that he could, in theory, afford to buy Twitter outright, very comfortably in fact. His decision to reject the offer of a board seat now leaves the door open, if he so wishes, to take an even larger stake in the company. There are other hints in Mr Agrawal's statement. He says Mr Musk was offered a position on the board - where he would have had to behave in the interests of shareholders. Is this a cryptic clue that Twitter wanted him on the inside, where perhaps he might do less damage? Musk is immensely powerful, his wealth and unpredictability makes him a possibly lucrative but also potentially dangerous investor. He clearly wants to change Twitter. But as a major shareholder with no board seat, what he does next is anyone's guess.

The trip was put together by Axiom Space, a private startup that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s booking rides with SpaceX and coordinating flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. What to know about Axiom Space, the company behind the first all-private mission to the ISS The passengers on this trip \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which includes former NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegr\u221a\u2260a, who will command the mission as an Axiom employee, and three paying customers \u201a\u00c4\u00ee are slated to take off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday at 11:17 am ET. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll ride inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, the same capsule that SpaceX has used to carry NASA astronauts to the ISS already. The capsule rides to orbit on top of one of SpaceX\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 230-foot-tall Falcon 9 rockets. This mission, called AX-1, will mark the first time in history that private citizens, or otherwise non-professional astronauts, will launch to the ISS from US soil. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the first of what Axiom, the company that organized and brokered this mission with SpaceX, hopes will be many similar flights for anyone who can afford it. The AX-1 mission is also only the second space tourism flight for SpaceX, following up the September 2021 launch of four private citizens on a three-day, freeflying trip through orbit that traveled even higher than the ISS. During their eight-day stay on the space station, the AX-1 crew will conduct some science experiments, break bread with the professional astronauts already on board the football-field sized space station, and enjoy sweeping views of our home planet whisking by down below. Lopez-Alegr\u221a\u2260a, 63, took of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA. He left the space agency in 2012, and he joined Axiom a few years later with the aim of going back to space \u201a\u00c4\u00ee but as a private astronaut rather than an official member of the corps. Axiom serves as an intermediary between paying customers who want to take a multimillion-dollar thrill ride to space, booking flights with SpaceX, handling negotiations with NASA, and taking over the training for the would-be space travelers. Axiom hopes to make these flights a regular occurrence, as NASA agreed a few years ago to open up the ISS to space tourism and other commercial ventures. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not clear how much these trips cost the customer. Though previously disclosed prices indicated a trip to the ISS is $55 million per seat, Axiom declined to confirm that figure this week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAxiom Space does not disclose financial terms,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Axiom spokesperson Bettina Inclan told CNN Buisness via email.) There are three paying customers on this flight. They are all wealthy white men, continuing a trend plaguing the commercial spaceflight sector and its inaccessibility to more diverse swaths of the population. The vast majority of people who have thus far been able to afford to pay their way to space \u201a\u00c4\u00ee whether on SpaceX flights or suborbital missions like those offered by Blue Origin \u201a\u00c4\u00ee have been white businessmen. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s indicative of just how far the reality is from the promised far-off space dream that comes from entrepreneurs who claim that space is \u201a\u00c4\u00fafor everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and commercializing space will \u201a\u00c4\u00fademocratize it\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 amid ballooning income inequality. With price points this exuberant, space will remain commercially accessible only to the elite few for the foreseeable future. Though the aim is to eventually drastically reduce the cost of getting to space, hopefully making ticket prices affordable for more people, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not clear how or when that will happen. Larry Connor, 72, is a real estate tycoon from Dayton, Ohio. He founded The Connor Group, which has developments in 16 markets across the country and has more than $3.5 billion in assets, according to the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s website. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s an avid adventurer, having raced cars and climbed mountains. He also has experience as a private pilot and has participated in aerobatic competitions, and he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be the designated pilot for this mission. (It should be noted SpaceX\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Crew Dragon is fully autonomous, though spaceflight pilots train to be prepared to take over is something goes awry.) \u201a\u00c4\u00faMy journey really started seven or eight years ago. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve always been interested in space, and I started thinking about after I read about an American who went to Russia and went on the Soyuz [spacecraft],\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said in an interview with the Dayton Society of Natural History last year, after his plans to fly on AX-1 were revealed. Connor was likely referring to one of the US citizens who booked a flight to the ISS through Space Adventures, a company that has booked seats aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft for tourists going back to the early 2000s. Those flight have always been coordinated with the Russian space agency and included official Russian astronauts. The AX-1 mission will be the first to include a crew made up entirely of private astronauts. Connor said he decided to book the mission for \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe challenge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are going to truly train to the professional astronaut standards,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.

Of the AX-1 mission, Pathy told CTV News: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is a lot of money. I feel very fortunate to be able to afford this kind of trip. Obviously not many people can. But at the same time I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to, fortunately, choose between doing something like this or being active philanthropically.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He added that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fabeen a dream since I was a little kid and watched Captain Kirk bouncing around the universe in the Enterprise\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to go to space. Eytan Stibbe, 64, is an Israeli businessman. According to his Axiom bio, Stibbe, a former fighter pilot in the Israeli Air Force, founded Vital Capital a decade ago. Its website states the company invests in companies involved in sectors like food and healthcare across developing areas, notably across Africa, for \u201a\u00c4\u00fahigh-return opportunities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Axiom says that Stibbe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s journey is happening \u201a\u00c4\u00fain collaboration\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the Ramon Foundation, a space education non-profit named for Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Stibbe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Axiom bio also says he and Ramon shared a \u201a\u00c4\u00faclose\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 friendship. Stibbe will be only the second Israeli to go to space. He announced his decision to join the AX-1 crew at \u201a\u00c4\u00e3a ceremony at the Israeli President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Residence in 2020, and it was met with criticism from Israeli press, which pointed to alleged dealings in Stibbe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s past, particularly related to accusations of trafficking military equipment \u201a\u00c4\u00e3during his time with LR Group, an investment and development group and which he left in 2011, according to a representative for Stibbe. Specifically, reports allege that Stibbe was involved in the sale of military aircraft in Angola, which was embroiled in a brutal civil war from the 1970s through 2002. The allegations trace back to reporting from Israeli news site Haaretz. In a television interview from 2012, which was conducted in Hebrew and translated by Israeli news outlets and CNN Business, Stibbe also appeared to confirm his involvement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe helped Angola end the war by bringing them interceptor aircraft, two Su-27 fighter planes, from Uzbekistan,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faTheir presence in the country stopped the flights that were supplying weapons, food and ammunition and the export of illegal diamonds from Angola. After one, or one and a half years, the war ended.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 A statement shared with CNN Business on behalf of Stibbe states that, \u201a\u00c4\u00faLR Group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s business in Angola dealt almost exclusively with agricultural infrastructure, vocational training, water, airports, and telecommunications.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 It adds that LR Group \u201a\u00c4\u00fareceived a request from the [US-backed Angolan] government to help upgrade its airspace infrastructure to ICAO international standards,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and that the aircraft sales were made \u201a\u00c4\u00fawith export licenses and were completely legal.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn addition, the aircraft and air-control radars were used for deterrence purposes only,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement reads. LR Group responded in a statement to CNN Business, saying \u201a\u00c4\u00faLR Group has been involved in the fields of health, telecommunications, food, agriculture, renewable energy and water, with the aim of developing the independence and economic and social well-being of local populations around the world.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faDuring the time when Stibbe was a partner in the company, he was serving as the partner responsible for the operation and financing of the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s business activity in Angola,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement reads. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAfter he separated from the company, he bought in 2012 the activity in Angola, and continued operating there.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 LR Group is currently involved in a legal dispute pertaining to allegations against Stibbe dating to when he was a partner at the company. Stibbe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s representatives declined to comment on the legal battle. As for his decision to go to space, Stibbe said \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a kid on dark nights I used to watch the stars and wait patiently to see a shooting star, and I asked myself, What is there beyond what the eyes see?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said in comments translated by i24NEWS.

More than 900 civilians killed in a matter of weeks. Is Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal? His country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine has presented reams of evidence that have led some world leaders \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including US President Joe Biden last week \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to use the loaded label. The question now is what Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which he followed up by calling Putin a \u201a\u00c4\u00famurderous dictator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapure thug\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will mean for the war in Ukraine going forward. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t signal any concern that Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks would roil talks with Russia. He told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Fareed Zakaria that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faready for negotiations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with Putin. (More on this in a minute.) Biden's strategy with Putin is decades in the making Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments represented a major moment since leading officials had mostly avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. But soon after the President uttered the words \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think he is a war criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to reporters at an unrelated event, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the comment was \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom the heart.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Other officials used similar language. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hard not to walk away with that conclusion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 State Department spokesman Ned Price later told CNN. And after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he \u201a\u00c4\u00fapersonally\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 agreed with Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s label of Putin, Psaki told reporters that the top US diplomat was speaking from the heart \u201a\u00c4\u00faas well.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Why all the parsing? While terms like \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar crimes\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are often used colloquially, they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Conventions, which specify intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime. In other words, the White House is being careful to not get ahead of the international investigations probing Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion. Will Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s words complicate Ukraine-Russia negotiations? The Kremlin called Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remarks about Putin being a war criminal \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Asked if it would be hard to sit down with Putin, Zelensky maintained Sunday that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ready \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and has been ready. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout delay,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 warning that otherwise Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s losses would be \u201a\u00c4\u00fahuge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The problem, as CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security team reports, is that US and NATO officials believe Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s engagement truly is \u201a\u00c4\u00ec even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion.

US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday also expressed her personal view that war crimes are being committed in Russia, saying that they \u201a\u00c4\u00faall feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but noted that there must be \u201a\u00c4\u00faa body of proof\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 before a legal determination can be made. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there is virtually no one \u201a\u00c4\u00ec maybe Vladimir Putin is the exception \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who can look at all of the photographs, all of video coming from Ukraine and not believe that Putin is intentionally targeting civilians, and intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in an interview with CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s John Berman on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow, I think we all feel it personally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sherman said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in terms of international law, you have to have evidence, you have to have a body of proof that in fact there was intentionality.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added that the United States is \u201a\u00c4\u00fahelping to pull that evidence together, present it to international justice parties and then have a legal threshold that is met.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 How long do war crime investigations take? Investigations at the International Criminal Court take many years, and only a handful of convictions have ever been won. Put differently, it could be a while before Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar criminal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 remarks have any legal weight \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if ever. As we noted earlier this month, the court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia. That seems unlikely.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is_not_biased"}]}

Greg Abbott directs use of buses to drop off migrants at steps of Capitol in DC\n    Article Content: Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin updates 'The Faulkner Focus' on the growing number of Democrats warning President Biden against reversing Title 42. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Wednesday that undocumented migrants released into his state will be shipped to the steps of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., as border checkpoints struggle to manage the flow of people attempting to enter the United States and the Biden administration's move to eliminate the Title 42 expulsion provision. The state will provide charter buses to drop off migrants \u2013 many released into small Texas communities that officials say are overwhelmed \u2013 in Washington, the Republican governor said in a news conference. \"We are sending them to the United States Capitol where the Biden administration will be able to more immediately address the needs of the people that they are allowing to come across our border,\" Abbott said. He noted that cities along the Texas-Mexico border have bused migrants to San Antonio. \"So I said I got a better idea. As opposed to busing these people to San Antonio, let's continue the ride all the way to Washington D.C.,\" Abbott said. The first location where migrants will be dropped off is the U.S. Capitol, officials said. W. Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said his agency will \"use as many buses as we need\" to follow Abbott's directive. In past emergencies, up to 900 buses have been activated for evacuations, he said. In addition, Abbott signed an order directing the state Department of Public Safety to conduct \"enhanced\" inspections of vehicles crossing into the U.S. from Mexico to ensure residents are not put in danger by unsafe vehicles or unsafe drivers. He also announced actions to deter illegal immigration, such as using razor wire in low-water crossings. This week, the Texas National Guard will begin the first phase of \"mass migration\" rehearsals in preparation for a potential influx of migrants at the border, officials said. Migrants are seen at the Rio Grande near the Del Rio-Acuna Port of Entry in Del Rio, Texas, on Sept. 18, 2021. (Getty Images) \"If you're a caravan organizer and you think you're going to overwhelm or overrun a port of entry, we'll be there waiting for you,\" said Maj. General Thomas Suelzer, the Texas National Guard adjutant general. Areas along the Texas-Mexico border used heavily by human smugglers will also see increased lighting at night, officials said. The actions announced Wednesday will be funded by local taxpayers. \"Securing the border does not come cheap,\" Abbott said. \"Securing the border would cost Texas nothing if the federal government was doing its job, but because Joe Biden is not securing the border, the state of Texas is having to step up and spend Texas taxpayer money doing the federal government's job.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The plan comes weeks before Title 42 is slated to expire on May 23.

Congress has been embroiled in a months-long stalemate over new funding to fight the pandemic, with House Democrats stripping additional Covid-relief money from a government funding bill earlier this month at the 11th hour after lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were unable to reach an agreement on how to offset the new spending. According to an administration official, the White House has secured funding to vaccinate children under 5 years old and offer a fourth booster shot to the immunocompromised. Beyond that, however, any other measures would require additional approval from Congress. The White House says that, of the American Rescue Plan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s $1.9 trillion in funding, just $300 billion remains unobligated, $240 billion of which has been allocated for cities and states already. The remaining funding \u201a\u00c4\u00ec approximately $60 billion \u201a\u00c4\u00ec is left for use for a specific emergency use by agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Republican lawmakers have said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll oppose additional funding to fight the pandemic without guaranteed offsets, a demand one senior administration official told reporters was disingenuous, given previous votes to secure emergency funding under the Trump administration that did not have earmarked offset funding. But the White House is warning lawmakers that, absent more relief funds, there won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be sufficient money to subsidize a number of Covid mitigation steps, including programs that provide resources for vaccinations, reimburse providers and insurers for out-of-network treatment, underwrite Covid testing and supply personal protective equipment. The White House has spent much of the last several weeks amping up its warnings that aspects of the federal Covid-19 response will be curtailed if new funding is not approved, with administration officials speaking in dire terms in a call with reporters last week. Among the warnings on that call were that there is not enough money to purchase booster shots for all Americans if another dose is required; domestic testing capability will decrease; the purchase of monoclonal antibody treatments and preventative treatment for immunocompromised individuals will be significantly scaled back; sending vaccines to the rest of the world will be affected; and major effects would be seen on research and development on Covid treatments.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The families of Americans being held in Russia\u2019s custody say they remain hopeful that the ongoing Russian conflict will not stymie their efforts to bring their loved ones home unscathed, despite their fears of time running out. Three Americans have been detained by Russian authorities for amounts of time varying from months to years. Nonetheless, the families of Brittney Griner, Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan remain relentless in their pursuit for their safe returns. \"We\u2019ve got to get our son back before he dies, or they put more charges on him.\" Meanwhile, Russia has waged war on Ukraine for more than six weeks, since Kremlin forces first invaded the country on Feb. 24. Since then, at least 1,611 people have been killed and another 2,227 have been hurt, according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Loved ones of two of the three people spoke with Fox News Digital this week, as they said they will continue to ensure their voices are heard despite the constant Russia news coming out of Ukraine.

(Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images) Paul Whelan, now 52, worked in corporate security for about 10 years before his normal life disintegrated at the hands of the Russian government. His job involved him traveling to corporate locations to test the physical security of facilities his company worked with. He had traveled to Russia a half-dozen times from 2008 and 2018, but his connection to the country \"was really just as a tourist,\" his twin brother, Paul, told Fox News Digital. \"He wasn't there visiting any locations. He didn't work there. He just had made contacts with people who were in Russia,\" Whelan said. \"He happened to be in Russia, he happened to be in contact with those people, and his life fell apart.\" Paul Whelan, a former US marine accused of espionage and arrested in Russia in December 2018, stands inside a defendants' cage as he waits to hear his verdict in Moscow on June 15, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images) Paul, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran from Michigan, was in Russia to attend a wedding in December 2018 when he was arrested in Moscow. He was accused of espionage and convicted in June 2020, when a Russian court sentenced him to 16 years in prison. \"In hindsight, probably every American going to Russia in the last two or three years should have been worried about their personal security,\" Whelan said. JACK BARSKY: WHAT A RUSSIAN SPY'S JOB MIGHT LOOK LIKE NOW, FROM ONE OF THE KGB'S 'BEST-TRAINED' DOUBLE AGENTS Paul became known for his \"feisty\" personality and for his unwillingness to crumble to the Russian pressures and has maintained his innocence. In one iconic image from his trial, Whelan, now TKTK, held a white sign that read, among other phrases, \"Sham Trial!,\" \"No Human Rights! Paul\u2019s Life Matters!\" \"Decisive Action from POTUS and PMs Needed!\" and \"Happy Birthday Flora,\" his beloved dog. David Whelan said he last spoke to his brother in October 2018, but he and his siblings have remained steadfast in their efforts to bring Paul home safely. \"From the day that he was arrested on Dec. 28, 2018, for about 18 months until he was sent off to Mordovia to the labor colony, none of us were able to speak to him,\" Whelan said. Since around September 2020, Paul has been able to make near-daily calls to his parents and is also allowed to call the U.S. embassy. But there have been times that the family has suddenly lost contact with him, such as in June of this year, when he was \"sent to a hospital without requesting it.\" \"We have our own suspicions about why,\" David said, describing how it was \"just before a meeting between President Biden and President Putin. \"And then as soon as he came back from the hospital, he was put in solitary for a month,\" David went on. For that almost two-month period, he was unable to make phone calls to our parents.\" David said his brother has tried to be vocal even behind bars about conditions behind bars, \"and we\u2019ve tried to help him amplify his voice and presence.\" Whelan said his family has weekly meetings with the U.S. Embassy in Russia, and have continued to do so despite the complications that have arisen from the Russia-Ukraine War. He lauded the work and support of U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan and said the embassy forewarned the Whelan family early on about their concerns regarding Russia\u2019s impending invasion of Ukraine. \"The real issue for us was, if sanctions go into place, what does that do to impact the ability for us to flow money Paul \u2013 money that we get put on his phone card, money that we put in his prison account, so he can buy fresh fruits and vegetables,\" Whelan explained. \"As soon as we saw that these things were potentially coming, even though we didn't know the day that they would happen, we transferred as much money from his trust account as we could to the U.S. Embassy, and they very quickly tried to move that onto his accounts and were successful.\" US ambassador to Russia John Sullivan speaks with the media outside the Moscow City Court in Moscow on June 15, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images) David estimated his brother would have enough money in his inmate account to last him for the next few months. But he said he feared the impacts of any additional sanctions on his brother\u2019s situation and their ability to regularly check up on him. \"I think the biggest concerns right now are the ability for the U.S. Embassy to continue to operate in Moscow. It's a key ally for us to be able to support Paul,\" Whelan continued. \"If he can't communicate with us, can't receive mail or packages from us, then he really is isolated. He's an American citizen who doesn't speak Russian in a Russian labor colony. I think everybody can imagine how awful.\" Whelan said his brother is largely unaware of the ongoing conflict, as he is only exposed to Russian-sponsored television, if at all. Asked how he felt the war could stymie his family\u2019s and the government\u2019s efforts to bring Paul home safely, he said: \"It complicates things.\" \"I don't know that Paul's case is necessarily off the stove,\" he went on. \"It may just be on the back burner for a while.\" WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 30: \u00a0Joey Reed and Paula Reed, the parents of Trevor Reed, a U.S. Marine who is currently being detained in a Russian prison, demonstrate in Lafayette Park near the White House on March 30, 2022, in Washington, DC.\u00a0 (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Trevor Reed, a now-30-year-old U.S. Marine Corps. veteran and former presidential security guard, had been living in Russia for the summer of 2019 when was arrested by Russian police and accused of assaulting a police officer. He had been celebrating in a park with his longtime Russian girlfriend and her colleagues at the time, his father, Joey Reed, told Fox News Digital. \"He was extremely intoxicated because they\u2019d been to a party for her law firm in a park,\" he explained. \"Everyone knew him because he\u2019d been there all summer in and out of the office all day long.\" At the time, Reed had been taking Russian language classes for an international studies degree through the University of North Texas, his father said. \"He got sick. They stopped to let him get out \u2026 They\u2019re kind of corralling him and, one of the people called the police,\" Reed went on. \"From then on, everything else is a lie, based on witnesses, based on video, based on expert witnesses who examined what little evidence that Russians allowed in courtroom.\" Police officers escort US ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, into a courtroom prior to a hearing in Moscow on March 11, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by ALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP via Getty Images) Reed\u2019s girlfriend and her colleagues followed police, who had taken Reed into custody, to the police station, where they were told to return at 9 a.m. to pick him up after he had sobered up. \"He should have never gone to the police station under Russian law. He was supposed to have been taken to a hospital,\" Reed said. When the woman returned to the police station with her mother at 9 a.m., they were greeted by agents from the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). \"She was frantic,\" Reed said. The concerned parents called the U.S. Embassy and ultimately hired the best lawyers they could. Russian law enforcement accused Reed of drunkenly grabbing an officer\u2019s arm and elbowing another while inside a police car on the way to the station.

(Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) Within months, the Reeds\u2019 lawyers, including one who was a retired judge, told them: \"Something\u2019s not right here.\" Reed said he later heard from top government officials, \"We\u2019re being told from the top people of Moscow to keep the heaviest charges on him and make sure that he\u2019s convicted.\" At his arraignment, Reed told the judge: \"Your honor, I don't remember anything that happened. I would never intentionally try and hurt a police officer. All my friends are police officers.\" His father said. \"He said, \u2018If you can show me that I did this, I'll plead guilty \u2026 and beg for mercy from the court.\" Following a public trial, Reed was convicted in July 2020 of assaulting police officers and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Much like the Whelan family, the Reeds meet with the U.S. government once a week to discuss their son\u2019s case. Joey Reed said they work with people who are assigned to nothing but handling their son\u2019s case. He said they also speak with the Whelan family regularly. Alina Tsybulnik (C), girlfriend of US ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, reacts during verdict hearing at Moscow's Golovinsky district court on July 30, 2020. His time in Russian prisons and labor camps has been concerning, the family said. \"He was essentially in solitary confinement, I believe, for over a year in a pretty bad prison,\" Reed said. \"Once he got to the labor camp \u2026 they would wake him up every hour. You know, they were punishing him for different things.\" He added: \"My son saw the sun maybe a dozen times in two years.\" Trevor pushed back against Russian authorities\u2019 efforts to make him work at the labor camp, telling them: \"I\u2019m not working for you. You\u2019ve taken me hostage, and I\u2019m not going to make stuff for you to make money on.\" Absent of a stricter housing facility within the camp, authorities have begun to accuse Reed of false violations that land him in solitary confinement. US ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, stands inside a defendants' cage during his verdict hearing at Moscow's Golovinsky district court on July 30, 2020.\u00a0 (Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images) \"They send you to solitary confinement, basically because you're refusing to work. And they make up reasons for it. But the real reason is you're refusing to work,\" Reed said. \"So, my son spent the first seven months there, basically in solitary confinement for 14 to 21 days at a time, and then they let him out for two and then they put him back out on more false charges.\" Trevor is sporadically able to make phone calls and communicate with his girlfriend or the embassy, but the correspondence is irregular and infrequent, Reed said. \"Our only communications for 232 days were through his girlfriend and occasionally he would call his attorneys in Moscow,\" Reed went on. \"But they would not let him call the embassy or us.\" Authorities further claimed that Trevor did not have the necessary calling card, then didn\u2019t have enough money on the card to make calls, and then would only allow him to speak on the phone in Russian. Trevor\u2019s situation has grown recently concerning in recent months after he grew ill with active tuberculosis and then began continuously coughing up blood. Reed said Russian authorities have recently refused to re-test Reed for active tuberculosis, despite Russian-sponsored media reports that have claimed that they did so several times. He was hospitalized for 10 days before he was returned to the camp and placed in solitary confinement once again. \"He\u2019s been sick almost the whole time he's been there,\" Reed said. \"You're not supposed to be put in solitary confinement if you're sick or injured, and he's both.\" On March 28, Trevor began a hunger strike in protest of his condition, prompting his concerned parents to travel from their home in Texas to Washington, D.C. to further embark on their media campaign in support of their son. Four days after the hunger strike began, Trevor was back in a hospital, where he called his girlfriend and said he had lost seven pounds since it started. Despite that the hospital usually provides Reed with opportunities to make outgoing calls, Trevor\u2019s girlfriend has not heard from him since. On Thursday, the family posted on a Twitter account \"Free Trevor Reed,\" writing: \"To the Russian Govt: Please let us speak to our son so we know he is alive and his condition.\" Earlier this week, the family said they had not received proof that their son was alive in almost a week. \"Our son is out of time,\" the family wrote. \"We are urgently calling on the Russian government to provide proof-of-life and resume allowing Trevor to call us. Our son is critically ill \u2013 this is not the time for cruelty for cruelty\u2019s sake.\" Reed told Fox News Digital that Reed\u2019s condition is \"getting worse and worse and we\u2019re able to help less and less.\" \"We\u2019re just afraid that we\u2019ve got to get our son back before he dies or has more charges put on him,\" Reed said. \"He\u2019s innocent.\" Brittney Griner is pictured in an undated photo after her arrest.

She is believed to be detained in a facility near Moscow, U.S. State Department officials have said.

In their appeal filed Monday, Trump and his children Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. argued that if New York Attorney General Letitia James wants their testimony, she should bring them before a state grand jury investigating the Trump Organization, where witnesses receive transactional immunity for their testimony in New York. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys wrote that if the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office is allowed to depose their clients, the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s constitutional and statutory protections can easily be \u201a\u00c4\u00faeviscerated if the same agency involved in the criminal investigation simply opens up a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2civil\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 investigation into the very same matters.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe question is whether the (Office of the Attorney General) can use the office subpoenas to avoid the grand jury process and compel testimony from those whom it does not wish to grant immunity,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the appeal states. A state judge ruled against the Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 request in February, saying they could invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refuse to answer questions, which Eric Trump did during his 2020 deposition. Attorneys for the Trump family argued that a jury could draw an \u201a\u00c4\u00faadverse inference\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if the Trumps opted not to answer questions in depositions. New York Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron had ordered the Trumps to sit for depositions by March 10, but the former President and his children reached a deal to delay those appearances until after an appeal is decided. James said in court filings in January that her office\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s civil investigation had uncovered significant evidence that the Trump Organization used \u201a\u00c4\u00fafraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage and tax deductions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and that financial statements had numerous \u201a\u00c4\u00famisleading statements and omissions.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 A parallel criminal investigation conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office has been looking into the former President and his business and whether they misled lenders, insurers and others by providing false or misleading financial statements about property values. But the investigation has reached an impasse, and two top attorneys resigned earlier this month after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he was not prepared to authorize an indictment against the former President, CNN previously reported. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys wrote that it is \u201a\u00c4\u00faundisputed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that the criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office targets the valuations and appraisals of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s properties in financial statements to taxing authorities and financial institutions, just as the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s investigation does. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys cited a filing from the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office in January where it writes that \u201a\u00c4\u00facoordination between parallel civil and criminal proceedings is standard procedure.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In their appeal, the Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys also ask the appellate court to reverse Engoron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision and allow there to be a hearing on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fascope and extent of coordination\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 between the Manhattan district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office and the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. The Trumps\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attorneys want to ask whether two attorneys from James\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 office are providing information or reporting back to the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. The Trumps also want to ask whether the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office is providing all of the information it has collected to the district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office, and whether it would immediately provide subpoenaed testimony to the district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office, among other questions. In a statement shortly after the appeal was filed, James said her office will continue to follow the facts. \u201a\u00c4\u00faDonald J. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump were ordered by a judge to comply with our investigation into Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial dealings,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 James said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faDespite continuous efforts to impede this investigation, no one can stop our pursuit of justice, no matter how powerful they are.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Attorneys for the Trumps again outlined public statements made by James about Donald Trump in their appeal, calling them \u201a\u00c4\u00faan extraordinary and unprecedented barrage of inappropriate public statements\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 since she ran for office in 2018, threatening to investigate and prosecute Trump and those close to him. The appeal argues that Engoron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision did not address James\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 comments, saying they reveal \u201a\u00c4\u00faextraordinary animus\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on James\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 part and cannot be ignored.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is_not_biased"}]}

The first arrivals since Russia's war began were shown wearing bright yellow suits with blue trimmings. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their fellow American, Russian and German crew. \"Sometimes yellow is just yellow,\" said the Roscosmos space agency. The ISS is a joint project between Russia, America, Canada, Japan and several European countries. It is led by a US-Russian partnership that has continued for two decades despite fluctuating tensions between the two world powers. Russian cosmonauts Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov docked at the ISS after a three-hour flight which blasted off from a Russian-owned facility in Kazakhstan. \"Congratulations on the successful docking,\" a voice from Russia's mission control said. A few hours later, two sets of hatches were opened and the three smiling men floated into the space station one by one in their yellow suits. The standard-issue Russian uniform is plain blue, and at least one of the men was seen wearing this before take-off. The moment was live-streamed by both Roscosmos and Nasa, the American space agency. \"It became our turn to pick a colour,\" Mr Artemyev said when he was asked about the suits in a live-streamed press conference. \"We had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it,\" he joked. \"That's why we had to wear yellow.\" Since the invasion of Ukraine, people around the world have used the colours of its national flag to show solidarity and support. But Roscosmos's press service dismissed the reports as a \"funny invention\" by foreign bloggers and media. \"The flight suits of the new crew are made in the colours of the emblem of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from... To see the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is crazy.\" The head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, is a strong supporter of the invasion and he suggested the claims that the cosmonauts were wearing Ukrainian colours had come from Ukrainian nationalists. Roscosmos later published another picture of Oleg Artemyev wearing an obviously Russian suit. The three Russians will begin a science mission on the ISS that is set to last just over six months. They will replace three current crew members who are scheduled to fly back to Earth on 30 March. The colours certainly speak to the moment, but what is the real motivation in wearing them? Does it signal support for Ukraine or the opposite? After all, the suits do display Russian flags. Perhaps neither view is correct. It has been suggested that the colours are a reflection of the fact that all three cosmonauts attended the Bauman Moscow State Technical University which has a similar colour scheme.  It's a \"Bauman crew\", the university has been trumpeting. The cosmonauts themselves, however, said noticeably little. What we do know is that 400km (248 miles) above the Earth, East and West have no choice but to continue friendly relations. While space co-operation is falling apart elsewhere - witness the ExoMars rover, for example - on the ISS the partners are joined at the hip. Russia provides the propulsion for the station, the Americans provide the power. The ISS cannot exist without either party. Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed?

The eldest Biden grandchild, 28, and her fianc\u00e9, Peter Neal, 24, will celebrate at perhaps the most exclusive venue in the US. Ms Biden said she was \"endlessly grateful\" to her \"Nana and Pop\" for the honour. Four other wedding receptions have ever been held at the presidential home. Ms Biden, a graduate of Columbia Law School and the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, announced her engagement to Mr Neal, a law student at the University of Pennsylvania, in September. Ms Biden will only be the fifth bride to have a White House wedding reception, to be held in November. The previous one took place in 2008, when Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former president George W Bush, celebrated a month after she was wed in Texas. It has actually been more common to hold wedding ceremonies themselves at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - there have been 18 in total. Since the first White House wedding in 1812 - between the sister of First Lady Dolley Madison and Thomas Todd - most have involved close family members of the first couple. The wedding of Nellie Grant, daughter of President Ulysses S Grant, in May 1874, was seen as the most elaborate event ever held at the White House at the time. Two hundred and fifty guests gathered in the East Room, decorated with masses of white flowers and Nellie's white satin dress fell into a six-foot train. Still, like many weddings, it was also a stressful affair. Mr and Mrs Grant were said to be concerned about their 19-year-old daughter's wedding to Algernon Sartoris, a diplomat. One sitting president has said \"I do\" at the White House: President Grover Cleveland wed Frances Folson in the Blue Room in June 1886. Other recent White House weddings have included those of Lynda Bird Johnson - daughter of President Lyndon Johnson - who married Charles Spittal Robb in a grand event in the East Room in 1967. In 1971, Tricia Nixon - daughter of President Richard Nixon and Pat Nixon, was the first to hold a wedding in the White House Rose Garden. The latest White House wedding, in 2013, was one of just three not involving family of the president. Pete Souza, who was chief White House photographer under President Barack Obama, married fianc\u00e9e Pattie Lease in the Rose Garden.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

Russia attempted to pay in rubles for two dollar-denominated bonds that matured on April 4, S&P said in a note on Friday. The agency said this amounted to a \u201a\u00c4\u00faselective default\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because investors are unlikely to be able to convert the rubles into \u201a\u00c4\u00fadollars equivalent to the originally due amounts.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 According to S&P, a selective default is declared when an entity has defaulted on a specific obligation but not its entire debt. Moscow has a grace period of 30 days from April 4 to make the payments of capital and interest, but S&P said it does not expect it will convert them into dollars given Western sanctions that undermine its \u201a\u00c4\u00fawillingness and technical abilities to honor the terms and conditions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of its obligations. A full foreign currency default would be Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first in more than a century, when Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated bonds issued by the Tsarist government. Russia cannot access roughly $315 billion of its foreign currency reserves as a result of Western sanctions imposed following its invasion of Ukraine. Until last week, the United States allowed Russia to use some of its frozen assets to pay back certain investors in dollars. But the US Treasury has since blocked the country from accessing its reserves at American banks, part of its effort to ramp up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and further diminish his war chest. JPMorgan estimates that Russia had about $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of last year, with about half of that held by foreign investors. Russia is now planning legal action. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will sue, because we undertook all necessary action so that investors would receive their payments,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will show the court proof of our payments, to confirm our efforts to pay in rubles, just as we did in foreign currency. It won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be a simple process,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. He did not say who Russia planned to sue. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a press conference last week that any default would be \u201a\u00c4\u00faartificial\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because Russia has the dollars to pay \u201a\u00c4\u00ee it just can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t access them. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are no grounds for a real default,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Peskov said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot even close.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Russia has gone to great lengths to artificially prop up the ruble \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which sank by as much as 40% to less than one US cent in the days after the invasion \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including by hiking interest rates to 20%, and by forcing exporters to swap most of their foreign currency revenues for rubles. That measure is still in place but the central bank has decided to relax some other restrictions, Reuters reported Monday, and last week announced that it was cutting interest rates to 17%. The ruble was trading at 79 to the US dollar on Monday, according to data from Refinitiv.

The five-figure penalties on the two flyers accused of violence are part of $2m (\u00a31.5m) in fines levied this year. US airlines have seen record numbers of disruptive passengers since early 2021, with many incidents involving the refusal to wear an anti-viral facemask. The fines were announced by transport secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday. \"If you are on an airplane, don't be a jerk and don't endanger the flight crews and fellow passengers,\" he said in an appearance on ABC's The View. \"If you do, you will be fined by the FAA.\" In one incident, an American Airlines passenger travelling from Texas to North Carolina has been asked to pay a $81,950 fine for threatening to hurt a flight attendant. The attendant had offered to help the passenger after she fell into the aisle of the plane. The unnamed passenger then allegedly pushed an airline worker and tried to open the cabin door. While flight attendants attempted to restrain her, she repeatedly hit one staff member in the head. When she was placed in cuffs, \"she spit at, headbutted, bit and tried to kick the crew and other passengers\", the FAA said in a news release. In the other incident, the passenger was flying on Delta Air Lines from Las Vegas to Atlanta. She allegedly tried to \"hug and kiss the passenger seated next to her, walked to the front of the aircraft to try to exit during flight; refused to return to her seat; and bit another passenger multiple times\". That passenger, who is also unnamed, was physically restrained by crew members and has now been asked to pay a fine of $77,272. Neither incident involved a failure to adhere to Covid measures. In his interview with The View, Mr Buttigieg said the US would decide by 18 April on whether to extend the federal requirement to wear masks on planes and in airports. The FAA announced a \"zero-tolerance\" policy on unruly passengers in January 2021, and has issued some $7m in fines since then. They have recorded 7,060 air rage incidents and say around 70% involved masking rules. But the rate of incidents has now declined by 60% since its high last year.

The four men are called the Axiom-1 crew. Axiom is a commercial spaceflight company that hopes to build its own space station in the next few years. The crew lifted away from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX Falcon rocket at 11:17 local time (15:17 GMT). Their capsule, known as Endeavour, is expected to dock at the station on Saturday. A former US space agency (Nasa) astronaut, Michael L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda, is commanding the mission. Flying alongside him are US real estate entrepreneur and aerobatic pilot Larry Connor; Israeli investor and philanthropist Eytan Stibbe; and Canadian entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist Mark Pathy. They'll get to spend eight days aboard the ISS, conducting scientific research and a number of outreach projects. The Axiom Space company was founded in 2016 to exploit the emerging market for commercial activities in low Earth orbit (LEO) - everything from tourism to manufacturing. The firm is planning a series of similar missions to the ISS. The next one, Axiom-2, will take place either later this year or in early 2023. This will include a crew member chosen through a reality TV series. The company has an agreement with Nasa to add its own modules to the American segment of the ISS. The idea eventually is that these modules will bud off on their own to become a fully private LEO destination just before the ISS is retired. While Russia allowed private astronaut endeavours to visit the 23-year-old station as far back as 2001, Nasa resisted the practice - until announcing a change in policy in 2019 designed to boost commercial opportunities. The agency is charging Axiom for accommodation and daily resources at the ISS. On the other hand, Nasa is purchasing from Axiom the capability to return certain scientific samples back to Earth when the company's crew departs. Friday's launch is the second private spaceflight facilitated by American rocket and capsule supplier SpaceX. Last year it sent up a mission called Inspiration-4. This was purchased by billionaire Jared Isaacman. He and his three crewmates circled the Earth at an altitude much higher than the station for almost three days.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

Those in captivity were forced to sing a parody of the Eagles' pop song \"Hotel California\" retitled \"Hotel Osama\", Nicolas H\u00e9nin said. It contained the lines: \"you will never leave/if you try, you will die\". Mr H\u00e9nin was the latest witness in the trial of El Shafee Elsheikh. The IS militant cell was known as the Beatles because of their British accents. An alleged member of the militant cell known as \"Jihadi George,\" Mr Elsheikh, 33, is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US, accused of kidnapping and conspiracy to murder. The court on Wednesday heard from Mr H\u00e9nin, who was abducted in June 2013 while working in Raqqa, Syria. He was blindfolded by men with AK-47s in the middle of the day and driven out of town, he said. When the blindfold was removed, he found himself alone in a cell, and would later come into contact with several other hostages. Mr H\u00e9nin testified that he witnessed brutal torture and was himself beaten until unconscious by men believed to be the so-called Beatles. The group have been linked to some 27 abductions and the murders of four Americans - journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. Prosecutors in the case argue that Mr Elsheikh was deeply involved in making ransom demands from the families of hostages for the group, and involved in the executions they carried out. He is also charged with conspiring in the deaths of the British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. The defence, however, have said that the Sudanese-born Londoner was not part of the group and merely \"a simple Isis fighter\". Mr H\u00e9nin said that he saw Mr Haines, who was starved and tortured so much that he \"at first sight looked like somebody at a Nazi concentration camp\", and Mr Foley, who was weak from \"intense torture\" and had had his ribs broken. Another captive, the Danish journalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, was \"a shadow of a man... so badly tortured that he was mentally and physically diminished\". Wounds on his wrists were \"so deep you could see his bones\", Mr H\u00e9nin said. He also encountered Ms Mueller, Mr Sotloff and Mr Kassig during his captivity, the Frenchman said. They arrived at various point during his detainment, he said, and were at one point held together in a small underground room they nicknamed \"the Dungeon\". Mr H\u00e9nin was released in April 2014, but others were not so lucky. Several family members of victims have testified about email exchanges with the captors as part of the prosecution's case. Earlier on Wednesday, the father of Peter Kassig recounted receiving a letter from his son saying he \"knew it was his time\", predicting his death before he was executed. Mr Elsheikh - on Wednesday wearing a white shirt and black face mask - sat back in his chair and listened intently to Mr Kassig's testimony, cocking his head slightly to look at the government's evidence, and making no eye contact with the witness.

Maybe it was because the 9.2% he now owns is described as a passive stake, although those who know Musk do not expect it to stay that way for long. His first move was to launch a poll - asking whether people want an edit button, something long called for and perhaps something he personally needs. The new announcement that he will join Twitter's board comes as no surprise. In a tweet on Tuesday, Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal said \"through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board\".

Musk's 9.2%  stake in the social media company may sound small, but Dan Ives, from analyst firm Wedbush, describes it as \"eye-popping\" - equating to 73.5 million shares in the social network. Shares in the platform soared following Monday's revelation that the Tesla founder had become the largest shareholder in the company - meaning that stake has already grown in value and is now worth more than $3bn. Musk's shareholding is four times greater than that of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive in November. Mr Ives believes the South African entrepreneur now has his eyes \"laser set\" on Twitter, and his significant holding will see him push for an active role in the management of the company. \"We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,\" he said. Musk has something of a love-hate relationship with Twitter. He is a frequent tweeter, with more than 80 million followers - and no stranger to controversy in his interactions on the social media site. The platform seems to suit his impulsive personality - last year he famously asked if he should sell 10% of his stock in his electric car firm Tesla, to which Twitter users said 'yes'. It led to Musk selling around $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of shares in the firm in November. Months earlier he had offered to sign a cheque for $6bn if the World Food Programme (WFP) could explain how it would be used to solve hunger around the globe - after an assertion made by the head of the UN programme. But tweeting has also got him into trouble. A 2018 post about Tesla stock led to an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission which ended with an agreement requiring the firm's lawyers to pre-approve certain tweets. It is unclear if that actually happens. Interestingly, the Wall Street Journal reports that his Twitter share filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which under normal circumstances would include a line saying he doesn't intend to influence the company, came with a 'Not Applicable' mark. The timing of the deal has also raised questions and could once again put Musk at loggerheads with financial regulators. His investment in Twitter was filed on 14 March, but not announced until this week. US securities law requires disclosure within 10 days of acquiring 5% of a company. Musk uses Twitter not just as a barometer for how he runs his own companies, but also increasingly to take the temperature of the nation. Last month, after he had lodged his investment with the SEC - but before his shareholding became public knowledge - he asked users whether they believed that free speech was essential to a functioning democracy and whether Twitter adheres to this principle. Cornell University's assistant professor Alexandra Cirone thinks this is evidence he may use his new stake \"to try to influence Twitter practices\" and for a \"more active play in the social media eco-system\". But others see more immediate issues with his musings. Howard Fischer, partner at law firm Moses & Singer, told Reuters that, given he had already bought a stake in Twitter, these questions could be seen as a form of market manipulation. \"I do suspect the SEC is going to look long and hard into whether they can bring manipulation charges, along with the failure to file,\" he said. Mr Agrawal is clearly watching his every move. In response to his edit button poll, which currently has 2.6 million responses, he urged voters to do so \"carefully\". Allow Twitter content?

Jack Dorsey had always rejected the idea, and critics point out that it could allow people to fundamentally change the meaning of tweets after they have been shared. It would be a big change for Twitter to include an edit button, and Musk is clearly keen to be part of that conversation. For a while last month, it looked as if Musk was intent on building a new social media platform as a rival to Twitter - and there he does have precedent from another prolific and controversial tweeter. Donald Trump, who was banned from Twitter in January 2021 after the Capitol riots, announced last autumn that he was launching his own social network - dubbed Truth Social - to \"stand up to the tyranny of big tech\". But six weeks after its launch, there is a waiting list of 1.5 million who are unable to use it - with the platform branded a disaster by Joshua Tucker, director of NYU's Center for social media and politics. According to Reuters, two key executives quit after the troubled launch. For those with shares in Musk's many other businesses - Space X, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company - there will doubtless be a sigh of relief that he didn't go down the same route as Mr Trump. But there will also be concerns that he has yet another passion project to distract him from the serious business of running his established firms. Not to mention the issues that might now be raised about the Twitter deal by the SEC. Social media expert Casey Newton points out that it is not the first time a big tech firm has eyed Twitter. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once bought a four percent share of the company \"and essentially did nothing with it,\" he writes. But he goes on to say that Ballmer never tweeted like Musk did: \"gleefully, annoyingly, constantly\". And it seems most likely that it will be from this Twitter account that Musk will let the world know what he intends to do next.

Justices voted 6-3 to reject defence claims Tsarnaev's 2015 trial was conducted improperly. Three people died and 260 others were wounded in the 2013 bombing, which Tsarnaev carried out with his older brother Tamerlan. Tamerlan was shot dead by police. In July 2020, a federal appeals court 'vacated' (removed) Tsarnaev's death sentence, arguing the judge in his original trial had failed to question potential jurors about how much they'd been following the case in the news. Additionally, the appeals court said the judge should have allowed the defence team to bring up a 2011 triple murder in a Boston suburb. Tsarnaev's lawyers had hoped to use the crime as evidence that he had been manipulated by his brother who had been a suspect in the case, and who they characterised as the mastermind of the bombing. While the court upheld his conviction, his death sentence was overturned. The Supreme Court's decision on Friday reverses that decision. \"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev committed heinous crimes,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote. \"The sixth amendment nonetheless guaranteed him a fair trial before an impartial jury. He received one.\" The Supreme Court's six conservative justices were the majority, with the remaining three liberal judges dissenting. No federal executions were carried out in the US for a 17-year period before the administration of former President Donald Trump. A total of 13 federal executions took place during the Trump administration. In July last year, Attorney General Merrick Garland imposed a moratorium on federal executions to allow the Justice Department to review the death penalty. Earlier this year, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the administration had \"grave concerns about whether capital punishment, as currently implemented, is consistent with the values that are fundamental to our sense of justice and fairness\". The Biden administration's Justice Department, however, defended the death sentence for Tsarnaev, and Mr Garland's moratorium did not prevent prosecutors from continuing to seek capital punishment in the case.

Four journalists have so far been killed reporting on the war and many more are injured or missing. Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna has been missing for more than a week, and her outlet believes she is being held by Russian forces. However, Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief of the Kyiv Independent, said journalist Oleh Baturyn, who was kidnapped last week in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Kakhovka, was just released by Russian fighters. The Kyiv Independent is a fairly new publication but has earned acclaim for its war coverage. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone from being a three-month-old startup and a relative unknown in the Western world to now one of the leading sources of information on the war in Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on Reliable Sources Sunday.

Rudenko said the outlet is learning as they go when it comes to protecting employees who have suddenly found themselves war correspondents. Several of the Independent\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reporters already had experience working in a war zone following Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Now they are once again working in dangerous locations, including Kyiv. One of the outlet\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s biggest fears is that Russian forces may cut off internet connections, hindering their ability to publish news. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe do not concentrate\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in one place, Rudenko said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are in different locations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Work goes on, but there is an emphasis on avoiding unnecessary risks. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are also telling reporters that safety is a priority,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rudenko said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo story is worth a human life.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But the psychological impacts will last after the war, Rudenko said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faJust being thrown into this,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rudenko said of the toll the fighting is taking. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis new reality where we cover this horror every day and every hour.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is_not_biased"}]}

It was a three-year battle of will (mine) over bureaucracy (theirs). I won. I have my grandmother to thank. I now have an elegant Swiss passport, the right to live anywhere in Europe, the theoretical chance to buy property in Switzerland and, more exciting than any of that, I have the right to vote. I haven't voted in almost two decades. I'm British but I have lived abroad so long that I lost my right to vote in the UK. I'm not American, so I can't vote in the country I live in. For years I've been disenfranchised. Now I get to vote again. A lot. We Swiss take voting as seriously as on-time trains and perfectly constructed wood piles. Every few months my local Swiss authority posts a packet to my house in Washington that contains a ballot paper with the next set of referendum questions, and a pamphlet with useful background reading on the different issues up for vote. It's all printed in Switzerland's multiple national languages. It's quite a thick packet. Since getting my citizenship, I've already voted on issues as varied as tobacco advertising, the quality of nursing care and depoliticising the judicial system. I became a citizen too late to vote to enshrine cycling into the constitution. Pity. America has a right to bear arms, the Swiss have a right to cycle. How can you not love this country? I suspect the Swiss get bored of voting every three months but I am relishing being a tiny cog in the massive machinery of state. I feel better, less guilty. Without a vote, I had become a passive citizen. I was a bystander to democracy, I wasn't a participant. Since coming into office, Joe Biden has spoken repeatedly about the tectonic struggle between democracy and autocracy. It's been the leitmotif of his presidency. His argument is that democracy must deliver for its people if it's going to survive. But there's another side to that social contract. We citizens have to deliver for democracy as well. For a start, we have to bother to vote. It's an activity America is famously bad at. In the 2020 election, one of the most consequential in recent history, only 62% of eligible voters bothered to turn out and vote. That was a modern day high. The UK doesn't do much better, 67% voted in its last general election. It doesn't have to be this way. Iceland, Israel and Turkey all have much higher voter turnout. Last weekend 70% of the Hungarian electorate turned out to give Prime Minister Victor Orban a much bigger win than expected. The opposition says Mr Orban's illiberal policies made it an unfair fight, they called it a \"legally massaged election.\" An authoritarian leader consolidating power in the heart of Europe will put strain on the continent, and the EU is clearly worried. Within days of his re-election, Brussels cut funds to Hungary for breaching the rule of law. Some democracies are fairer than others. Even the worst however, to echo Winston Churchill, are worth protecting. I grew up all over the Middle East, in countries that don't have elections. I learned young that there are too many people around the world who don't have a vote at all, for us to simply squander ours. I am not a curmudgeon by nature, but the longer I couldn't vote as an adult, the more draconian I became about the act of voting. If I ran the world, I'd be tempted to take a leaf out of Australia's book and make voting mandatory. Of course it's not just the lack of participation that weakens liberal societies. Twenty-first century democracies are hotbeds of social and economic inequality. The poor get poorer and the rich get richer. Many democracies, like the US, have such polarised political systems that you can't get laws passed that would make lives better. They've become virtually ungovernable. Long-term challenges, like climate change, get kicked down the road as politicians focus their efforts on short term gains, like getting re-elected. Democracies aren't giving the next generation the tools they will need to be responsible democratic citizens in a complicated, changing world. Our kids need lessons on how to spot real news from fake news and how to avoid baseless conspiracy theories that undermine the strength of democracy itself. The false conspiracy perpetrated by former US President Donald Trump that he won the 2020 election has become the rationale for a wave of new laws across the US that make it harder to vote. It's also the reason Americans' belief in the system itself is growing shaky. A recent NPR/Ipsos poll found 64% of Americans believe US democracy is at risk of failing. The sentiment is felt most strongly among supporters of Donald Trump. But those new laws may undermine Democrats' faith in the system too. If the next US presidential election is decided in states with those new voting laws, it's possible we'll see angry Democrats then take up the mantra of a stolen election. It's alarming how easy it is to undermine people's faith in democracy with a lie. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the fragility of America's democracy was what alarmed foreign observers here. I am part of a generation that has taken political pluralism for granted. Decades of peace produced a failure of imagination. Despite the war tales our parents told us, we couldn't envisage that a way of life we'd all got used to might disappear if we didn't defend it. Ukraine has snapped us awake. It has shown us both the risks, and, more inspiringly, what it means to really care for democracy. In a war they didn't choose, Ukrainians are fighting, and dying, for the right to free elections, to the rule of law, and an impartial media, for the right to be a democratic country. Their bravery puts our laziness to shame.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Two Washington, D.C. men accused of posing as federal agents were \"tipped off\" about the federal investigation into their scheme just one day before they were arrested, and \"shipped\" evidence out of their apartment, a Sunday court filing by prosecutors states. Arian Taherzadeh, 40, and Haider Ali, 35, were both arrested on April 6 at a luxury apartment in the Navy Yard area of Washington, D.C during a multi-federal government agency raid of several apartment units. They were charged with false impersonation of a federal officer in a U.S. District Court on Thursday. Federal prosecutors filed a motion for detention on April 8, arguing that Ali is a flight risk and Taherzdeh could attempt to obstruct justice. Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey said on Friday that he needs more details about Ali's travel history to Pakistan and Iran, additional details about \"United Special Police LLC,\" which Taherzadeh allegedly controls, as well as detailed information about Taherzadeh's history as a deputized special police officer with the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. DC JUDGE WANTS DEEPER PROBE OF POSSIBLE FOREIGN TIES FOR MEN WHO ALLEGEDLY IMPERSONATED FEDERAL AGENTS In an attempt to prove he was an employee of the Department of Homeland Security, Taherzadeh took a picture of himself in a Department of Homeland Security Investigations \"vest.\" The Secret Service agent also allegedly saw multiple pictures of Taherzadeh in police tactical gear, according to prosecutors.

(Department of Justice) In an attempt to prove he was an employee of the Department of Homeland Security, Taherzadeh took a picture of himself in a Department of Homeland Security Investigations \"vest,\" according to prosecutors. (Department of Justice) A Sunday court filing by prosecutors reveals that Taherzadeh was \"tipped off\" about the federal investigation, and attempted to conceal evidence by \"shipping it out of their apartment complex.\" When the Federal Bureau of Investigations and multiple other federal government agencies executed their search warrant on April 6, shipping materials and UPS labels were found, which raised a concern that evidence was being shipped out of the apartment, according to the filing. One day after the search warrant was executed, April 7, prosecutors state that a Secret Service member who Taherzadeh provided a \"rent-free penthouse\" allegedly received a package sent through UPS Next Day Air with a return label stating \"USSP,\" and an address that corresponded to Taherzadeh and Ali's apartment complex. The package contained a number of smaller boxes where Sauer and Glock firearm cases were found, and correspond to the \"apparent purchases of a P365 9MM Sig Sauer, a P365 XL 9MM Sig Sauer 9MM , and a Glock 19 Generation 4 9MM,\" according to the filing. The firearm case for the P365 Sig Sauer 9MM also held three ammunition magazines, which prosecutors say appears to be a high-capacity magazine. Prosecutors state that the federal government was \"conducting constant surveillance\" of the men when the items were shipped, and believe that they could have been aware that the government was keeping a close eye on them, and believed that shipping evidence was a way to \"remove evidence without the Government\u2019s detection.\" WASHINGTON D.C. MEN WHO ALLEGEDLY POSED AS FEDERAL AGENTS HAD STOCKPILE OF WEAPONS, NEW FILING SHOWS The package shipped to the Secret Service member also contained a cigar case with four cigars, which prosecutors say \"is consistent with the prior pattern and practice of providing federal law enforcement agents with gifts and items of value.\" (Department of Justice) One day after the search warrant was executed, April 7, prosecutors state that a Secret Service member who Taherzadeh provided a \"rent-free penthouse\" allegedly received a package sent through UPS Next Day Air with a return label stating \"USSP,\" and an address that corresponded to Taherzadeh and Ali's apartment complex.

Ammunition magazines recovered during the search of Ali\u2019s Glock 19 and Taherzadeh\u2019s Sig Sauer are \"illegal, high-capacity magazines,\" prosecutors also allege. DC MEN WHO ALLEGEDLY POSED AS FEDERAL AGENTS UNDER SCRUTINY FOR POSSIBLE FOREIGN TIES Federal law enforcement agencies enter an apartment building in Washington, D.C. (Fox News/Kelly Laco) A former U.S. Marine who the men attempted to \"recruit\" told the government that he observed illegal weapons, which include \"an AR-15/M4 variant automatic rifle with an illegal suppressor that had also been modified to be an illegal automatic weapon, and an AR Pistol with a modified brace consistent with the firearm parts recovered during the execution of the search warrant.\" Prosecutors argue that the release of Taherzadeh and Ali would \"endanger the community and risk their flight from justice and obstruction of critical evidence.\" On April 6, federal law enforcement officers recovered multiple firearms as well as ammunition while executing a search warrant. According to a court filing by federal prosecutors on April 7, \"numerous electronic devices\" were also found, including a \"significant\" amount of surveillance equipment, 30 hard drives, a machine that creates and programs Personal Identification Verification cards, and blank cards with chips. Federal prosecutors filed a motion for detention on Friday morning, showing some of what the Federal Bureau of Investigations and other agencies found when they executed the search warrant on Wednesday, which includes a stockpile of weapons allegedly owned by Taherzadeh and Haider. (Department of Justice) Passports belonging to Ali were also recovered during the raid, which show two visas from Iran. Prosecutors say that the first visa authorized travel to Iran from July 31, 2019 through October 28, 2019, and the second from October 28, 2019 through January 25, 2020.\u00a0The passports also contain visas from Pakistan. Federal prosecutors also allege that Ali told two witnesses that he has some type of connection with the Pakistani Intelligence Service, the Inter-Services Intelligence. The scheme by the two men began to fall apart when a United States Postal Inspector arrived at their apartment complex to investigate an alleged assault involvingcan w a United States Postal Service carrier, according to prosecutors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The case was eventually handed to the Federal Bureau of Investigations after the men identified themselves as employees of the Department of Homeland Security who worked on a special task force related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

Prosecutors allege that the individuals \"compromised\" Secret Service personnel who have access to the White House \"by lavishing gifts upon them, including rent-free living.\" The detention hearing will continue on Monday afternoon.

A woman staying at the Grand Beach Hotel in Miami spotted Instagram model Courtney Clenney with her father Friday at the hotel's lobby bar\u00a0after the April 3 stabbing death of her boyfriend, Christian Tobechukwu Obumseli. Obumseli, 27, suffered \"an apparent knife wound\" in a domestic violence incident before first responders rushed him 2 \u00bd miles away to the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami police said in a statement. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.

The discovery of a wild-born Eastern indigo snake marks the success of an intensive program to reintroduce the reptiles to the state. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe snake found yesterday indicates the project is resulting in some thriving and reproducing indigos, just what we wanted!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division said Thursday on Facebook. \u201a\u00c4\u00faReintroducing a species to its native range is a daunting task, and we celebrate each step of its success!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The reptile, which is the largest snake native to the US, used to be found throughout Alabama. But they went extinct in the state in the 1950s, largely due to habitat loss, according to the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The snakes, however, are a crucial element of the ecosystem. Jim Godwin, an animal biologist with the Alabama Natural Heritage Program administered by the Auburn University Museum of Natural History, told CNN that Eastern indigo snakes were historically the \u201a\u00c4\u00faapex predator\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the longleaf pine forests where they live. A decline in the snake\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s population, therefore, has a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadomino effect\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on other species in the ecosystem. So in 2006, a team of Alabama conservationists launched a project to reintroduce the Eastern indigo snake to the state. Starting with wild-captured individuals from Georgia, where the snakes are also found, they began to breed a captive population. In 2010, the first snakes from the captive population were released into Conecuh National Forest. The goal is to eventually introduce a total of 300 snakes to create a healthy and viable population in Alabama. The discovery of wild-born Eastern indigo snakes means the released snakes survived and had offspring, providing a glimpse of hope for the species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 success in Alabama. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is an excellent indicator that the snakes that we have released, which were born into captivity, have been able to adapt to the wild, are functioning as wild snakes, and are reproducing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Godwin. The snake discovered was clearly wild-born due to two factors, according to Godwin: its small size and its lack of a PIT (or passive integrated transponder) tag. The hatchling was clearly smaller than those released from captivity, which were usually at least two feet long; the snakes can grow up to eight feet long in adulthood. And the released snakes are tagged with PIT tags, which have small microchips allowing researchers to identify each animal by its unique code. The first wild-born Eastern indigo snake was discovered in Alabama in 2020, according to the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Both snakes were actually found by accident, according to Godwin, who explained \u201a\u00c4\u00fait\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s difficult to just go out and do a search for them, because they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re small, and they can hide very easily.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 During the winter, the project team monitors the burrows of gopher tortoises, where the adult Eastern indigo snakes breed in the colder months, in hopes of identifying the animals. The reintroduction project has been an ongoing collaboration between Auburn University, the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the US Forest Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and other partners, Godwin said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

Specifically Ari Wegner, a name you're going to be hearing a lot more often from now on. It may be 2022, but the combination of both a female director and a female director of photography is still a rare occurrence in Hollywood. The pair combined to create an unsettling and menacing western which tackles toxic masculinity and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as complicated, malevolent cowboy Phil, who forms an unlikely friendship with a younger man, Pete (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The film is leading the pack at this year's Academy Awards with 12 nominations, including best picture, best director and best cinematography - Wegner could be the first woman to win the latter. For many, that female recognition is cause for celebration after the so-called \"male gaze\" has dominated Hollywood for so long. But is there such thing as \"the female gaze\" and if so, what does that bring to a traditionally male genre like a western? Campion, who is now the first woman to be nominated for two best director Oscars, isn't sure. \"It's so hard to know how much to believe in the female gaze or the male gaze,\" she tells the BBC. \"I think, to me, it's really the artist's gaze, bringing your sensitivity to the story. [But] I really wanted to have a woman cinematographer on this film, because there's so many other men and I really like to support women.\" Wegner, who previously worked with Campion on a commercial, told the BBC's culture editor Katie Razzall: \"There probably is a gender element to it, but it's also just what interests you, what your upbringing is, what you notice. \"And I think maybe Jane and I are similar in that way, really fascinated by subtle kinds of energy between people and what's not being said.\" Campion says it's thanks to the film's \"feminist\" producer Roger Frappier that she got on board with the project in the first place after a meeting in Cannes. \"It's very lucky that he really trusted me with this story, which you would think is a book for the kind of big-guy type of person that would handle ranch material - even though I do ride horses, and my parents did have cattle on the farm (Campion grew up in New Zealand). \"I was grateful to him for believing in me. And I was grateful to Savage's book, which is kind of subversive... when you think about most western genre movies, they're really a kind of celebration of masculinity in one way or another... and often a romanticised version of what a man is. \"In Savage's hands, he ripped through it really, and showed us a very true and different version.\" His version is one Campion and Cumberbatch have faithfully brought to life on screen through the latter's swaggering, snarling and insidious presence. The film also stars real-life couple Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst as Phil's brother and his wife Rose, who is also Pete's mother. The film is Campion's first in more than a decade and has been largely well received by critics, with The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw describing it as \"one of Campion's best\" and Empire's Beth Webb noting that while the \"narrative here feels somewhat underdeveloped... Campion remains a master of sensory storytelling\". The Netflix film is another feather in the streaming giant's cap, but Cumberbatch recently told Vanity Fair he wished the film had enjoyed a longer cinema release (it had a finite two-week run before it headed exclusively to Netflix). Campion concurs. \"I'd have loved it to have been out in the cinema for longer but that wasn't the plan that Netflix had. However, I would have to say that we wouldn't have made the film at all without Netflix. They were the only people that were willing to pay what this film cost to make and they are incredibly supportive.\" She adds that Netflix are now putting the film out in cinemas again \"because of the 12 nominations that we got and you know, the general interest in it and people wanting to see it on a big screen\". Campion also points out that streaming brings the film - which is essentially an arthouse one - to a bigger and wider audience, making it more accessible.  And she's delighted with the attention it's getting, including the awards buzz. \"I'm kind of thrilled. I feel like I've had kind of a comeback. I do feel really quite moved. People in the Academy have voted for so many categories.\" She also understands it has greater significance for women in the industry as a whole after the shocking revelations about the abuse of women in Hollywood including the Harvey Weinstein scandal. \"I really feel that the MeToo movement changed everything. I think it was a very dark time in the late 90s. And up to about 2015. It was almost as if nobody was hearing the fact there was such a depth of inequality. \"And when those brave ladies shared their stories... everybody woke up and went: 'It's really been impossible, and it's incredibly unequal, and we're not going to have it.' \"It's just not OK to have so little representation of women in film and TV. I think women are doing so well. It's no longer charitable to be employing women. And that's the big change. We want to be recognised because we are really good!\" Wegner is also blazing a trail on the awards circuit. As well as the Oscar nomination, she is the first woman ever to receive a Bafta nod for best cinematography. \"I think the visibility really matters because everyone's the harshest critic of their own work, but it is something very meaningful to be recognised by your peers,\" she told Razzall. The Australian says she was \"so na\u00efve\" when she first decided to go into her field. \"I had no idea that it was not a job that women usually did. It wasn't really until later in film school that I heard this term female cinematographer. And it slowly dawned on me that there were very few but... it was too late. I'd already decided [my career].\" The most recent annual Celluloid Ceiling report found that women comprised 21% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers working on the top 100 grossing films in 2020, up from 20% in 2019. Women also make up 50% of movie-goers. Campion says: \"We just have to keep going this way. It can never go back to what it was. It was a really dark time when people didn't want to see what women thought or made films about but now there's a real appetite amongst audiences, men and women. \"Netflix are actively seeking to keep their ratio of material made by women up. It's acts like that that make a real difference. \"And hiring Ari for an ambitious film like this one. Is that a risk? Well, I don't think it was a risk. She's really talented. All she needed was people that believe in her and to give her that opportunity, supporting her to make sure she does succeed. And she did succeed. Brilliantly.\" The Power of the Dog leads Oscar nominations\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

The regulation on so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00faghost guns\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec unregulated, untraceable weapons made from kits \u201a\u00c4\u00ec would address a critical gap in the government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to track them. Growing ghost gun problem adds to America's violence woes Biden is also expected to name Steve Dettelbach, a former US attorney from Ohio, as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as soon as Monday, according to a US official. Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s previous nominee was forced to withdraw amid opposition in the Senate. The moves come as gun violence and crime have ticked up in the United States, putting pressure on the White House to take action. Biden was expected to address new steps on guns in a public event Monday afternoon, according to people who have received invitations. The White House declined to comment on the new steps, which were described by three people familiar with the matter not authorized to speak publicly. Dettelbach did not respond to a request for comment. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer again decried the use of ghost guns during a press conference Sunday, calling for a crackdown on the rise of the privately made firearms and speaking about a deadly shooting in the Bronx Friday. The New York Democrat on Sunday blamed Republicans for holding up gun reform legislation, while pressing Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration to go further. \u201a\u00c4\u00faToday I am calling on the administration to go all after ghost guns, by putting out regulations that will stop them. The federal government has the ability through regulation to stop these ghost guns,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Following a 2021 directive from the Biden administration, the ATF proposed a rule in May last year to allow the bureau to classify the building blocks that often make up ghost guns as firearms. The rule has been winding its way through the federal regulation process since then. The ATF rule addresses a key problem in tracking and regulating ghost guns because certain frames and receivers used to assemble the guns are often purchased online and not classified as firearms by the bureau. The rule would also require manufactures who sell parts to assemble ghost guns to be licensed and to run background checks on potential purchasers of the kits used to assemble the products. The Justice Department has also launched a national ghost gun enforcement initiative, which will \u201a\u00c4\u00fatrain a national cadre of prosecutors and disseminate investigation and prosecution tools to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the White House. Ghost guns have been used in multiple recent shootings, including at a Maryland high school in January. The exact number in circulation is unknowable, given the inability of regulators to track them. Multiple states have moved to restrict their sale as ghost guns become more common at crime scenes. Last week, Maryland joined Washington, DC, and 10 other states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in banning or restricting the purchase or use of ghost guns, which are often bought online and assembled at home. In September, Biden withdrew his nomination of David Chipman to lead the ATF after facing opposition from Republicans and certain moderate Democrats. ATF nominee failed to disclose talks and events to Senate committee, including speaking on politics of agents Chipman, a former career official at ATF, came under scrutiny from pro-gun rights supporters and the National Rifle Association for his work as a senior adviser to Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the organization started by former Rep.

Maxwell was convicted of trafficking girls and her lawyers want a new trial, arguing the jury were not impartial. Her case was thrown into disarray when this juror told the media he had told other jurors about his own abuse. The hearing in New York will establish whether or not Maxwell is retried. Maxwell, the daughter of a late British media tycoon, was convicted in December of grooming teenage girls for abuse by the late Jeffrey Epstein. She faces up to 65 years in prison but maintains her innocence. Epstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The juror in question, who asked to be identified by his first and middle name, Scotty David, was given immunity from prosecution earlier on Tuesday. When asked why he failed to disclose his past in the jury questionnaire when explicitly asked, he said it was an \"inadvertent mistake.\" \"This is one of the biggest mistakes I have made in my life,\" he added, saying he \"flew through\" the document and was \"super-distracted\" by everything going on around him in the jury room. After the conviction of Maxwell he had told reporters that he had shared his own experience of sexual abuse with jurors after some had questioned the recollections from two of Maxwell's accusers. This admission immediately prompted Maxwell's lawyers to demand a retrial. They argued that him sharing his experience with other jurors could have made them more sympathetic to her accusers and meant she never got a fair trial.

But she has yet to address it publicly. Instead, she says, she made the purposeful decision to return to the spotlight with her craft. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI was just on my little ranch in Canada with my dogs and my gardens and everything. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been a long time since I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done anything, but I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve never done anything at this level.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Anderson then stands up and walks to two adjacent closets filled with designer clothing. She begins holding up dresses, jackets and blouses that all look a bit familiar. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because they are. Anderson shipped her most iconic looks from the 90s to wear in New York. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI never shop,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she says, holding a Chanel jacket. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is all from stuff that I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve had for forever. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m only shopping in my closet,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she laughs. Anderson says the preparation for \u201a\u00c4\u00faChicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 has been all-encompassing \u201a\u00c4\u00ec she even finds herself waking up in the middle of the night, reciting her monologue. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m dreaming and I wake up and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just talking. And then I go, okay, that was interesting. I go back to sleep and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s just like, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m dancing in my mind,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not a dancer. So I had to kind of put all this together. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even know how I did it. The show is very physical. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m doing the original choreography, which I think doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always happen. So they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re giving me everything and you get one thing and they give you more. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2No! I just learned this. Now there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a whole exit dance?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 My head, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to explode. But I do it. And then I get it. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Okay, I got this.\u201a\u00c4\u00f2\u201a\u00c4\u00fas After about 30 minutes responding to questions, Anderson trails off, staring at a towering pile of papers on the other side of her sprawling hotel suite. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s her long-awaited memoir. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also doing a documentary with Netflix. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen I was a lot younger, I took my power back in certain situations, and it feels the same way [now],\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt feels like another step closer to taking my power back and really taking it back. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s very empowering. And it does feel I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m being supported. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m being rooted for, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a new feeling for me. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to let anybody down, but I also really don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to let myself down.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 As for all of the recent attention she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s getting, she says she believes this Broadway role \u201a\u00c4\u00famight be the beginning of something really interesting for me.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd in a way where I feel respected, honored, all those weird things that I never felt before. So it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a very strange feeling \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I always knew, even as a young girl, I remember at five years old thinking that I was going to do something that was going to be unexpected. \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 not to prove people wrong, but just to prove to myself that I was much more capable of something great.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-not-biased"}]}

The United States and allies believe that North Korea is beginning to prepare for a possible underground nuclear test for the first time since 2017. North Korea has recently resumed digging tunnels and construction activities at its underground nuclear test site, according to five US officials. Commercially available satellite imagery had shown some indications of activity on the surface at Pyongyang\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remote Punggye-ri nuclear test site. It is not yet clear how soon the regime would be capable of testing a device at the site, as it depends on the pace of the activity, the officials say. The preparations for a possible underground nuclear test come after North Korea tested its first suspected intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017 last month. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe remain concerned about the North Koreans \u201a\u00c4\u00ec their attempt to continue to improve their nuclear capability as well as their ballistic missile capability,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Tuesday. Kirby declined to be more specific about what he was referring to regarding the regime\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nuclear capability. In 2018, North Korea appeared to destroy at least three nuclear tunnels, observation buildings, a metal foundry and living quarters at its Punggye-ri site, in a process observed by invited international journalists that CNN reported at the time. A CNN crew at the remote mountain site in the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s north witnessed explosions at nuclear tunnels 2, 3 and 4, from observation decks about 500 meters away. They were among two dozen journalists invited to the country to observe the apparent destruction of the site. The move was seen at the time as North Korea making a gesture toward denuclearization to the Trump administration, but in the wake of ongoing rhetoric, then-President Donald Trump canceled a planned meeting with leader Kim Jong Un. Officials told CNN that US and allied intelligence agencies assess that digging activities at previously shuttered underground tunnel areas are underway, which would be critical for the resumption of underground nuclear testing. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests at the site, which lies north of Pyongyang, the most recent and powerful of which was in September 2017. There are also indications that North Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s next ballistic missile test could come as soon as the next few weeks, one official said, though the official would not specify the reasons behind that assessment, and US officials say they believe Kim is likely to resume testing a nuclear weapon. The US intelligence community estimates North Korea could be ready to conduct a nuclear test this year, according to the annual threat assessment report by the director of national intelligence published last month. The DNI said nuclear testing and long-range missiles tests are \u201a\u00c4\u00falaying the groundwork for an increase in tensions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by the regime. The Defense Department is considering a package of military responses to North Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recent test of an improved intercontinental ballistic missiles that could range from flying bombers or sailing warships in the region to beefing up exercises and training, according to the defense officials. Japan and South Korea are being consulted on a potential decision and could be part of any show of force that is decided upon, the officials say. The concern that nuclear testing could resume in the near future comes as North Korea has demonstrated a missile that could potentially reach the US. The Pentagon is still assessing to what extent the missile is an improved version of previous launches. North Korea reports the missile had a maximum altitude of 3,905 miles and flew a distance of 681 miles with a flight time of 68 minutes. The missile test was accompanied with Hollywood-style edited video complete with a soundtrack and footage of Kim.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-not-biased"}]}

Sharif, the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-N party and younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, received 174 out of 342 votes in Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote in parliament and is set to serve as prime minister until the next general election, which is expected to take place in 2023. All of Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lawmakers from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party resigned en masse in protest ahead of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vote, and there will now have to be urgent elections to replace them. Following the vote, Khan called on his supporters to take to the streets. His next rally is scheduled for April 16 in Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan. In a speech to parliament ahead of his swearing in, Sharif spoke of unity across the country, including his coalition government. He said he would introduce a 10% increase in pensions and raise the monthly minimum wage rate to Rs 25,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec equivalent to US $136 per month. India\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Sharif in a Twitter post that added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIndia desires peace and stability in a region free of terror, so that we can focus on our development challenges and ensure the well-being and prosperity of our people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s appointment as the 31st prime minister of Pakistan comes after widespread protests in support of Khan erupted across Pakistan late Sunday. Tens of thousands took to the streets in key cities, including Lahore and Peshawar, to support the ousted leader. They chanted slogans against the United States \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which Khan had claimed was involved in a conspiracy against him \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s powerful military, which had seemed to withdraw its support from him. Against this backdrop of political turmoil and a crumbling economy, Sharif now faces a challenging period as the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader. Unlike Khan, Sharif has maintained an amicable relationship with the military and was a popular chief minister of Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s politically important and most populous province of Punjab. He was lauded for his ambitious administrative and infrastructure projects in the province, which saw advances in the education and industrial sectors. Sharif was instrumental in driving the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a part of China\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Belt and Road Initiative, and maintains a positive relationship with Beijing. A member of the wealthy Sharif dynasty, which amassed millions by producing steel, his family was mired in scandal after his brother Nawaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison and handed a $10.5 million fine over corruption charges in 2018. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan ousted as country's leader following vote of no-confidence Shehbaz Sharif rejected the verdict, calling it \u201a\u00c4\u00faflawed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapolitically motivated.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shehbaz Sharif is also facing charges for alleged corruption. In recent months, Sharif had led a campaign to remove Khan as Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leader over claims of economic mismanagement and poor governance. Along with the opposition, he had urged Khan to resign ahead of a no-confidence vote that was widely expected to dismiss Khan. Tensions smoldered for days, with Khan repeatedly rejecting the criticism and instead claiming the moves against him were an attempt at regime change backed by Washington and some members of the opposition. The allegations were denied by both the US State Department and the Pakistani opposition. In a dramatic series of events, the deputy speaker in parliament blocked the no-confidence vote against Khan. Khan then dissolved parliament and called for early elections. The opposition challenged Khan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s moves in Pakistan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest court, with Sharif calling them \u201a\u00c4\u00fanothing short of high treason.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The court ruled last week that the blocking of the no-confidence vote against Khan was unconstitutional, paving the way for Sharif\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rise to power.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

The U.S. has transferred a significant number of Patriot antimissile interceptors to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks as the Biden administration looks to ease what has been a point of tension in the increasingly complicated U.S.-Saudi relationship. A senior administration official confirmed Sunday night that the interceptors have been sent to Saudi Arabia. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that has not been formally announced, said the decision was in line with President Biden\u2019s promise that \"America will have the backs of our friends in the region.\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday condemned Houthi forces in Yemen after they unleashed one of their most intense barrages of drone and missile strikes on Saudi Arabia\u2019s critical energy facilities, sparking a fire at one site and temporarily cutting oil production at another.

The kingdom has insisted that the interceptors are critical to their defense against Houthi attacks. The Saudis have been locked in a stalemate war with the Houthis since March 2015. At the time the U.S. Patriot systems were moved out of the kingdom, administration officials said the shift in defense capabilities was made in part due to a desire to face what American officials see as the looming \"great powers conflict\" with China and Russia. Pentagon officials noted that the U.S. maintained tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing \"some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities.\" A member of the U.S. Air Force stands near a Patriot missile battery at the Prince Sultan air base in al-Kharj, central Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 20, 2020.

The U.S.-Saudi relationship has been strained since Biden took office.

SAUDI ARABIA SAYS IT HAS EXECUTED 81 CONVICTS IN SINGLE DAY The killing of Khashoggi, a critic of MBS, drew global condemnation. The crown prince insists he was not involved in the operation carried out by Saudi operatives. In a recent interview with The Atlantic, the crown prince was asked whether Biden misunderstands something about him. He responded, \"Simply, I do not care\" and that it was up to Biden to think \"about the interests of America\" when weighing his dealings with the Saudi monarchy.

But what about the rest of the world? When California issued a statewide stay-at-home order on 19 March 2020, most people thought that life would return to normal relatively quickly. A full 24 months later, people are finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, with restrictions being eased in the US and several other countries. But with some places experiencing record numbers of cases yet again, it's clear that the pandemic isn't ready to let go its grip just yet. We asked our correspondents in the UK, Hong Kong, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Peru and the US to give us a snapshot. Nick Triggle, London England's last remaining Covid restriction - the legal requirement to isolate after a positive test - was lifted at the end of February. It came a month after the government lifted the requirement to wear masks in places such as shops and on public transport and the advice to work from home where possible. But the truth is England has had a pretty light-touch approach to regulations compared to many places since the summer. The masks mandate and working from home advice was only reintroduced in late 2021 as the Omicron variant took off. The approach is based on the fact that vaccines are providing great protection and England has seen very good uptake among those groups most at risk - 95% of over-60s have had a booster jab. It has meant that despite the surge in infections caused by the Omicron variant, the number of people dying has been similar to what would normally be seen during a normal winter. There are signs infections may be starting to climb again, but it is causing little concern at the moment. Pumza Fihlani, Johannesburg South Africa is largely back in business. The government lifted most lockdown restrictions last December, which brought an end to a night-time curfew for the first time in nearly two years, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol (South Africa was one of a few countries to ban alcohol sales at the height of the pandemic in 2020). Today across the country's main cities and towns, life has returned to normal with the hubbub of people commuting to work and play in full swing. There is one unmissable indicator that Covid is still with us, however, the mandatory mask wearing in all public places - which is followed by most people. With reason, because cases are once more decreasing according to official figures, following a fourth wave which hit the country a few months ago driven by the omicron variant. Most schools have reopened but there are discussions about introducing vaccine mandates at tertiary institutions, which is proving a contentious issue. And what does socialising look like? Nightclubs are still closed to the public, but people can now be out until late at bars and taverns without worrying about being arrested for violating curfew. Simon Atkinson, Sydney For almost two years, my friend across the Tasman in Wellington has been very blas\u00e9 about this pandemic. Then, this week, came a raspy WhatsApp voice message. \"We've all got bloody Covid! It has gone nuts.\" Her family is far from alone. While tough lockdowns and virtual isolation helped the country get a reputation as a Covid success story, now transmission rates have soared. And many Kiwis are struggling to grasp how their country has gone from fewer than 1,000 cases a day to more than 20,000 cases in just a couple of weeks. It's not that long since Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was still valiantly pursuing a strategy of elimination. Some comfort amid that psychological shock is that there have been fewer than 120 Covid deaths during the entire pandemic, largely thanks to 95% vaccination rates in the eligible population. Most restrictions have now been eased, and isolation requirements for Covid patients are being reduced. But mandates, meaning unvaccinated people in some sectors lost their jobs, led to three weeks of protests in the capital Wellington and remain in place. Double-jabbed New Zealanders are now able to come home from overseas without quarantine or isolation requirements - a huge deal given borders were shut for almost two years. Travellers from 60 other countries, including the US and UK, will get the same treatment from 2 May - with a negative test. Grace Tsoi, Hong Kong The Omicron variant has been a rude awakening for Hong Kong. The city follows mainland China's \"Zero Covid' strategy, which involves stringent border control, aggressive contact tracing and strict quarantine rules, and managed to keep the virus at bay for the first two years of the pandemic. By the end of 2021, only about 12,000 cases were recorded. Today, it has the world's highest death rate, with most of the victims being unvaccinated elderly. More than half a million have caught the virus. The virus is still spreading, even though harsh social distancing measures have been in place. Restaurants cannot offer dine-in service after 18:00, and venues such as gyms and bars have been shut since January. People are angry and confused by the handling of the crisis. Quoting government sources, local media reported on a possible citywide lockdown accompanied by compulsory testing for 7.4 million residents. Such news has sent people into panic, and shelves have been emptied in supermarkets. However, city leader Carrie Lam said this week universal testing was no longer a top priority. This devastating wave will eventually end. Most will either have acquired natural immunity after infection, or been vaccinated. But one can't help asking if Hong Kong will still need to stick to the \"Zero Covid\" strategy when local businesses are struggling and international talents are fleeing the city? Katy Watson, Sao Paulo Peru was one of the quickest - and toughest - places to impose lockdown. Strict curfews were brought in, not even dog owners could exercise their pets at the start of the pandemic, such was the policing of quarantine. But that didn't stop Peru being hit badly and hospitals being overrun. In short, the necessity for people to carry on working in this poor country - added to the fact that the underfunded public health service wasn't prepared enough - meant the death-toll soared. But fast-forward two years and something that felt so all-consuming seems to be part of everyday life now - restrictions are easing and infections are falling. There are of course reminders of the pandemic - masks are still being worn and many places ask for proof of vaccines before people are allowed to enter. That said, Peruvians are probably more preoccupied with the country's political crisis than health at the moment. The country's President Pedro Castillo is now on his fourth cabinet in seven months. His predecessor, Martin Vizcarra, who led the country through the initial lockdown, was impeached in 2020. Between health and politics, it's been a tumultuous few years in Peru. Robin Levinson King, Toronto The spring will bring a thaw to more than just an icy winter in Canada, as Covid restrictions across the country are eased. With most of the Covid rules falling under provincial, not federal guidelines, the rollout has been staggered, but it is near universal. Every province or territory that had a vaccine passport - often required to access indoor services such as restaurants - will drop them by April, with proof of vaccine still required for some professions such as long-term care workers. Mask mandates are also falling by the wayside, including in schools. Federally, air and rail travel still require masks and proof of vaccination and even people who are fully vaccinated must test upon entering the country, at least for now. However, the government has started to ease up on testing requirements for Canadian citizens. These decisions come after a weeks-long anti-Covid restriction protest that held the national capital hostage and blockaded one of Canada's most important trade routes. While the decision to ease restrictions not been officially attributed to the demonstrators, some may view the rapid changes as a concession, or a victory. For most of the pandemic, the country followed strict protocols, with restaurants and gyms shut down in several cities for months on end and, when they did reopen, they issued vaccine passports. Some in the country wish it had stayed that way. While polls suggest the majority of Canadians want restrictions to end, some individual businesses are choosing to still require proof of vaccines and masks, which means that for some, the pandemic is far from over. Tara McKelvey, Washington, DC At Georgetown University in Washington, N95 masks, once a valuable commodity, sit in boxes unused, a sign of how Covid restrictions have changed in the city and across the US. Currently, the rules allow people to live their lives almost as before. Of course, the restrictions vary, depending upon where a person lives, but the general picture is one of freedom. Texas and Florida, two Republican states, have few, if any, mask requirements. Even Democratic-majority states, places that once had strict mask rules, have dropped the requirements, going further than the White House guidelines that were in place at the time. New York and New Jersey, for example, have ditched their indoor mask mandates. These policies reflect a greater confidence about the pandemic. While the US leads the world in total Covid deaths per population, nationwide, new cases have dropped to 36,000 a day, down from a staggering 800,000. The number of individuals admitted to hospital is also down by 75%. As a result, the mood is relatively upbeat, says Silicia Lomax, who works for a health-policy consulting firm in Washington, with people returning to ordinary life. A couple of months ago, she says, her commute on the subway was ghostly: \"I could almost count on having a car to myself,\" she says. \"But now it's pretty packed.\" Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

The vehicle, known as the Space Launch System (SLS), was taken to Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to conduct a dummy countdown. If that goes well, the rocket will be declared ready for a mission in which it will send an uncrewed test capsule around the Moon. This could happen in the next couple of months. Ultimately, it's hoped astronauts would climb aboard later SLS rockets to return to the Moon's surface sometime in the second half of this decade. These missions are part of what Nasa calls its Artemis programme. Watching the roll-out, agency administrator Bill Nelson said we were entering a golden era of human space exploration. \"The Artemis generation is preparing to reach new frontiers,\" he told the spectator crowds gathered at Kennedy. \"This generation will return astronauts to the Moon and this time, we will land the first woman and the first person of colour on the surface, to conduct ground-breaking science. \"Nasa's Artemis programme will pave the way for humanity's giant leap (to) future missions to Mars.\" SLS is a colossus. A touch under 100m in height, it was designed to be more powerful than the Apollo Saturn vehicles of the late 1960s and early 1970s. It will have the thrust to not only send astronauts far beyond Earth but additionally so much equipment and cargo that those crews could stay away for extended periods. Thursday's rollout from Kennedy's Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the rocket's debut in the sense that it's the very first time everyone has got to see all its different elements fully stacked together. The SLS move from the VAB began 17:47 local Florida time. The rocket came out attached to a support gantry known as the Mobile Launcher. This structure, which is itself 120m high and weighs 5,000 tonnes, was sitting atop the same mammoth tractor that used to move the Saturn Vs back in the day, and later the space shuttles. The Crawler Transporter goes very slowly, with a cruising speed of just over 1km/h (under 1mph). And after engineers had stopped and started the tractor for various checks, it was 04:15 on Friday morning by the time the procession had reached Pad 39B. A total journey distance of 6.75km. SLS will now be prepared for a \"wet dress rehearsal\", likely to occur on 3 April. This will see the rocket loaded with propellants and taken through a practice countdown all the way to a mere 9.4 seconds from the moment of lift-off. The \"scrub\" point is just before they would normally light the four big shuttle-era engines under the rocket. Assuming everything proceeds to the satisfaction of the engineers, Nasa will then be able to set a flight date. The end of May remains a possibility, but more likely it will be June or July. This mission, dubbed Artemis-1, will propel the rocket's Orion crew capsule on a 26-day journey that includes an expanded orbit around the Moon. There will be no-one in the capsule for the test flight. This should happen on a second mission in a couple of years' time. While Nasa is developing the SLS, the American rocket entrepreneur Elon Musk is preparing an even larger vehicle at his R&D facility in Texas. He calls his giant rocket the Starship. Like SLS it has yet to have a maiden flight. Unlike SLS, Starship has been designed to be totally reusable and ought therefore to be considerably cheaper to operate. A recent assessment from the Office of Inspector General, which audits Nasa programmes, found that the first four SLS missions would each cost more than $4bn to execute - a sum of money that was described as \"unsustainable\".\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-not-biased"}]}

(KPTV/ pool camera) In opening statements on Monday, however, the defense said Nancy was at a Starbucks in Washington County when her husband was shot. The defense also presented loving messages shared between Nancy and her husband to prove that the couple was on good terms before Daniel's shooting. PHILADELPHIA MAN KILLED IN GAS STATION SHOOTING SURVIVED GUNFIRE WEEKS EARLIER Court documents further allege that Nancy called detectives in June requesting a letter stating she was not a suspect in her husband's homicide to provide to her life insurance company because she had a policy for Daniel valued around $40,000. Prosecutors also claimed that following her husband's death, Nancy made claims on 10 life insurance policies valued around $1.4 million for which she was the beneficiary, according to FOX 12 Portland.

But if for whatever reason, he was not happy with the students, he could be pretty harsh,\" Borcherding testified, according to the outlet.

Amir Locke was at his cousin's apartment on 2 February when a Swat team entered the home. Prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to charge officer Mark Hanneman, who fired the fatal shot. They also said they did not have enough evidence to prove criminal wrongdoing by any of the other officers involved. Mr Locke was sleeping in a couch in his cousin's apartment when a nine-member Swat team entered the home. In bodycam footage released by the police after the incident, he is under a blanket on the couch holding a gun - for which he had a permit - in his hand. He was shot three times by Mr Hanneman. His family has said they believe he was startled and reached for the weapon in self-defence. A judge had approved a warrant for the raid, which was conducted as part of an investigation into a fatal shooting in the neighbouring city of St Paul. Mr Locke was not a suspect in the killing or named in the warrant, and his death prompted outrage and protests in Minneapolis. On Wednesday, County Attorney Michael Freeman and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement that there was \"insufficient admissible evidence to file criminal charges in this case\". The circumstances in the case \"are such that an objectively reasonable officer in Officer Hanneman's position would have perceived an immediate threat of death or great bodily harm\" the statement said, adding that \"an objectively reasonable officer would not delay in using deadly force\". The statement also said that Mr Locke, an aspiring musician, was a victim and that his life mattered. \"He should be alive today, and his death is a tragedy\". Mr Locke's mother Karen Wells said in a news conference following the announcement that she was \"disgusted with Minneapolis, Minnesota\". Her son's death drew comparisons to the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot and killed in her Louisville, Kentucky home by US police in March 2020 during another no-knock raid, which allows police to access without announcing their presence before entering. Ms Wells vowed to \"continue the fight for the no-knock warrant bans in honour of his name [and] for Breonna Taylor\". \"This cannot happen to anybody else,\" she said. As of Friday, Minneapolis police will no longer be allowed to apply for or execute no-knock warrants or respond to such requests from other police forces, barring certain '\"exigent\" circumstances, the mayor's office said this week.

The shooting took place Monday on the grounds of East High School, though not within the school building. Gunshots were fired by multiple shooters from multiple vehicles, police said. A 15-year-old boy who did not attend the school was killed, and police said he was the intended target of the shooting. Two female students also were shot and remain hospitalized \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a 16-year-old in serious condition and an 18-year-old in critical condition, according to police. The incident is at least the 13th shooting at an American campus with K-12 students in 2022, according to a CNN tally. After the shooting, Des Moines police detectives carried out five residential search warrants and six vehicle search warrants and recovered six firearms, police said in a news release. Six Des Moines residents between the ages of 14 and 17 have been charged with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder, according to police. Police said they started receiving multiple calls reporting gunfire at the school at 2:48 p.m. and found the three victims outside when they arrived. All three were rushed to hospitals. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile this incident occurred outside of a school, it could have occurred in any one of our neighborhoods,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Des Moines police said on Facebook. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe school is where the suspects found their target. The rapid response by DMPD officers, and the swift action by the school staff placing the building in lockdown and sheltering students and staff in place, certainly had a positive impact on safety and scene management.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 East High School Student Kaylie Shannon told CNN affiliate KCCI that she was in a car outside the school when she heard shots. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI was just sitting in my friend\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s car and then all of the sudden I heard 11 gunshots and some boys screaming,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Shannon said. The school went under lockdown for more than 40 minutes, but students were dismissed around 3:30 p.m. when police gave an all clear, according to a statement from Des Moines Public Schools. Sgt.

Shootings in and near schools have become too common, Superintendent Thomas Ahart said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur staff and students are forced to train for these incidents and the trauma associated with the repeated drills and incidents will remain with them for years to come. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unfortunate that our state and our country have become a place where firearms are far too easily accessible.

The Department recommends that children with underlying conditions are the best candidates for the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 it says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faParents are encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits with their children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health care practitioner when evaluating whether their child should receive a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for children with underlying health conditions or comorbidities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Florida is the first state to break from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations that everyone age 5 and older receive the vaccine. Why Florida is now recommending healthy kids *not* get vaccinated against Covid-19 Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Lapado announced the measure on Monday during a roundtable discussion hosted by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Explaining the decision, DeSantis said Ladapo was concerned that the vaccine was \u201a\u00c4\u00fabeing pushed on people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are not just going to follow the CDC in the state of Florida,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to do our own stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The guidance released Tuesday says that the risks of the vaccine outweigh its benefits in children who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have underlying health conditions. It cites reports of increased incidence of myocarditis \u201a\u00c4\u00ec inflammation of the heart muscle \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in 16- and 17-year-olds who got the Covid-19 vaccine. The study that the guidance uses to support this concern also found that the risk of myocarditis is rare, identifying 105.9 cases per 1 million doses of the mRNA vaccine given in 16- to 17-year-olds. Florida surgeon general favorably recommended after Democrats walk out of confirmation hearing The guidance also cites data from a clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found no cases of severe Covid-19 in a group of children ages 5 to 11, whether they received the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. However, that study found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing Covid-19 infection. The department also based the guidance off a New York-based study that found vaccine effectiveness for children ages 5 to 17 dropped significantly during the Omicron surge. But that research concluded that the vaccine continued to be effective against severe disease in children. That study is a preprint and has not been published in a peer-reviewed professional journal, so a note in bold at the top of the study advises that it should not be used to guide clinical practice. Health experts have been very critical of the department\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recommendations. CDC director rebukes DeSantis for scolding high school students over masks: 'It is absolutely their choice' In a statement Tuesday, Dr. Daniel P. McQuillen, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said his group \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrongly opposes the state of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to put politics over the health and safety of children. The Florida Surgeon General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to recommend against COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children flies in the face of the best medical guidance and only serves to further sow distrust in vaccines that have proven to be the safest, most effective defense against severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The head of the University of Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health system sent an email Tuesday to staff that distanced the medical network from Ladapo in light of Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Dr. David Nelson, the senior vice president for health affairs at the university and president of UF Health, told staff that Ladapo does not speak for the school and acknowledged that his opinions clash with those of other medical experts. Ladapo is a professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine through an agreement with the state. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. Nelson also assured staff that the university\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s position was that vaccines are \u201a\u00c4\u00fasafe and effective, with a very low risk of adverse outcomes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe recognize there is sometimes significant disagreement among knowledgeable individuals on policy issues surrounding the COVID pandemic.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. More than 500 workers at a Chevron Corp. refinery in the San Francisco Bay area went on strike early Monday in a contract dispute. The United Steelworkers union said in an email that the strike affecting the refinery in the city of Richmond, began at 12:01 a.m. It came after workers voted down Chevron\u2019s most recent contract offer and that Chevron refused to return to the bargaining table. BIDEN BLAMING HIGH GAS PRICES ON RUSSIA IS CYNICAL AND DISGRACEFUL Chevron said in a statement Sunday night that it has negotiated with the union for months and believes a contract offered by the company was fair and addressed union concerns. The company said that refinery operations will continue despite the strike and that it does not anticipate any supply chain issues. If the strike were to shut down the refinery, that could negatively affect gasoline prices in California \u2014 which has the highest regular gas price in the nation at $5.86 per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.

Chevron said that in Richmond, \"the union\u2019s demands exceeded what the company believes to be reasonable and moved beyond what was agreed to as part of the national pattern bargaining agreement.\" The old contract with Chevron in Richmond expired Feb. 1, and workers had been reporting to their jobs on a rolling 24-hour extension, the union said.

The diplomatic spat is over a letter seeking support for a draft Russian resolution about aid in Ukraine. Canada posted the letter to Twitter with \"suggested edits\", which led to retweets from other UN missions. A Russian diplomat has called it \"Russophobic libel\". An image of the letter - annotated in red type - was posted on Canada's official UN mission Twitter account on Thursday. The letter, signed by Russian diplomat Vassily Nebenzia, had been sent to all UN members the previous day. In it, Mr Nebenzia says he is \"reaching out with regards to an urgent matter related to the dire humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine\". Canada's annotation adds to that line: \"which we have caused as a result of our illegal war of aggression\". The letter goes on to say that \"Western colleagues\" are \"politicising the humanitarian issue\". Canada adds \"Do you think the UN membership actually believes this? Please explain.\" Dmitry Polyanskiy, first deputy permanent representative of Russia to the United Nations, responded to the tweet, saying it \"shows that your diplomatic skills and good manners are at lowest ebb\" and reminding Canada that it twice failed to secure enough support to win a non-permanent seat on the powerful UN Security Council. The letter was meant to boost support for a draft resolution on providing humanitarian relief in Ukraine, which was scheduled for a vote on Friday at the UN Security Council. The resolution has been criticised by Western nations for its failure to mention Russia's responsibility for the war. That scheduled vote was cancelled by Russia on Thursday.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A 72-year-old woman accused of hate crimes against her Vietnamese neighbor has agreed to sell her Seattle-area home as part of a civil agreement with the victim and her family, according to reports. As per the agreement, Jan Myers, who is White, is expected to sell her home in Shoreline, Washington, about nine miles from downtown Seattle, within the next six months and pay the victim, Thi Pham, who is Vietnamese American, $45,000 from that sale, KGW reported. If Myers fails to move from the neighborhood before the time frame is up, the case could be referred to a civil jury. NYC TEEN CHARGED WITH HATE CRIME AFTER GROUP ATTACKS HASIDIC MAN IN BROOKLYN The ordeal began in April 2021 when Pham said she was outside in her front yard gardening when she noticed Myers sitting in the roadway staring at her and beginning to move her car back and forth. Fearful of what would happen next, Pham said she began recording and Myers is seen yelling several racial slurs and threats. Jan Myers is facing hate crime charges for alleged racially charged threats against her Vietnamese American neighbor Thi Pham\u00a0 (King County Sheriff's Office) In the video, Myers is heard calling Pham \"slant eye\" and \"Miss Vietnam\" and threatening \"you\u2019re not going to live very long.\" Pham called police afterward. Two weeks prior, Pham said Myers had walked onto her patio naked from the waist down making obscene gestures in front of her two-year-old son. Myers was charged with a hate crime in April 2021, but a judge released her without bail on her own recognizance shortly after. Pham and her husband, Bill Healy, filed a civil lawsuit in King County Superior Court in August 2021, claiming Myers violated a no contact order and continued to harass them. The couple alleged that Myers screamed at them outside and drove her car straight at Healy. Attorneys for Pham and Healy announced the civil settlement at a press conference Thursday. \"I am happy that I can safely live in my home without racial harassment,\" Pham said, according to KING-TV. \"We hope Jan Myers follow through the agreement and move quickly.\" \"That was what made it very difficult, is when I realized my wife and my family, their physical well-being and their life was being threatened by this person,\" Healy said, according to KIRO.

Edward Kassig held back tears as he read a letter from his son, Peter Kassig, one of four Americans killed by the terror cell known as the Beatles. Alleged member El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, is accused of kidnapping and conspiracy. He has denied all charges. The elder Mr Kassig is the latest family member of victims to give evidence at the trial of Mr Elsheikh, who is the highest profile IS fighter to face justice in a US court. Describing his son's final letter, Mr Kassig said: \"This was a young man knowing his time had come. It was his farewell.\" Then he read the letter. \"I spent a long time taking life for granted and taunting death,\" his 26-year-old son wrote. \"I have never wanted to live more. I don't want you and Mum ruined over this.\" He said he \"cried a lot in the first few months, but not anymore\". Prosecutors in the case argue that Mr Elsheikh was deeply involved in ransom demands from the families of hostages, and the executions the so-called Beatles carried out. The defence, however, have said that the Sudanese-born Londoner was not part of the group and merely \"a simple Isis fighter\". Several family members of victims have testified about email exchanges with Beatle captors as part of the prosecution's case. Ed Kassig recounted receiving the first in December 2013 saying: \"Peter is at this moment our guest and we don't want to harm him\" and later, a message demanding 100 million euro in exchange for his release. The Kassigs had several subsequent email exchanges with their son's captors. In a video message to IS, they said their son \"grew to love Syria\" and had \"embraced Islam\" - a nod to his conversion while in captivity, and changing his name from Peter to Abdulrahman. They were able to receive a letter from their son in June 2014, even as they appealed to the White House and told the IS captors they were \"turning every stone\" to meet the ransom demands. However, the IS group released a video in November 2014 apparently showing Mr Kassig being executed. A FBI agent confirmed his death to the family, Mr Kassig said. His son had been a \"caring kid\" and particularly \"sensitive to the needs of others\", he told the court. He had served in the US Army and did a tour in the Middle East before becoming an aid worker after going to Turkey in 2013 and taking trips over the border to Syria, his father said. He founded the aid group Special Emergency Response and Assistance (Sera) because he \"realised there was a lethal time lag between when war breaks out and aid comes in,\" and it provided food and medical supplies to anyone in need. \"It didn't matter if it was a jihadi or a refugee,\" Mr Kassig said. Mr Elsheikh - on Wednesday wearing a white shirt and black mask - sat back in his chair and listened intently to the testimony, cocking his head slightly to look at the government's evidence, and making no eye contact with the witness. The trial continues, with as many as 50 witnesses expected.

The five-time Masters champion had to overcome a poor start to his round, before an up-and-down back nine helped him recover and put him in a tie for 19th. It marks his 22nd consecutive cut at the famed tournament, one shy of the record held by Fred Couples and Gary Player. It came on a day of thrills and spills, including a hole-in-one for a veteran golfer and a player losing his club head after hitting the ball. But eventually, Woods carded a two-over 74 to finish at one over for the tournament so far and ensure he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be playing over the weekend. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWell, I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t feel as good as I would like to feel. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s OK,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Woods told the media afterward. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAs I said, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got a chance going into the weekend. Hopefully I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll have one of those light bulb moments and turn it on in the weekend and get it done. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve seen guys do it with a chance going into the back nine.

I need to get myself there. \u201a\u00c4\u00faTomorrow will be a big day. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be cool. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be tough. Again, the wind is supposed to blow again and tough scoring conditions. I need to go out there and handle my business and get into the red and get myself a chance going into that back nine on Sunday.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Scottie Scheffler \u201a\u00c4\u00ec who was recently named world No. 1 after a run of excellent form \u201a\u00c4\u00ec produced a late burst with a five-under par 67 Friday, to shoot into the lead at the halfway point of the Masters, with an overall eight-under par 136 and a five-stroke lead, a record after 36 holes. Woods capped off a remarkable comeback to golf Thursday as he carded a one-under 71 in the opening round at Augusta National. The 46-year-old Woods displayed all his poise and experience to finish near the top of the leaderboard, just four shots behind leader Im Sung-jae at the end of the day. As he looks to complete what would be another fairy-tale story and make the cut in his first appearance in a professional golf tournament since his February 2021 car crash, Woods hoped for more of the same on day two of the 2022 Masters. With a large crowd watching on and anticipation in the air, the 15-time major winner stepped up and blasted his ball down the first hole, only for it to find the bunker on the right of the fairway. He would end up bogeying the opening hole, moving him back to even par for the tournament. And his slow start to the second round continued over the next two holes, rescuing a par on the par-five second hole before missing a short putt on the third hole for his second bogey in three holes, putting him at one over par. Unfortunately for Woods, another bogey was to follow on the par-three fourth hole, when his par putt fell just inches short. According to the PGA Tour, the three-over through four holes start is Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 worst score through four holes in 92 career rounds at the Masters Tournament. It got worse for Woods still, as another bogey on the fifth hole dropped him to three over for the tournament. However, from there, Woods slowly recovered. He earned hard-fought pars on holes 6 and 7 before a vital birdie on the eighth hole helped drag him back to two over. And the recovery only got better from there, with the shot of his second round so far coming on the 10th hole, leaving him with a very short putt for a second birdie in three holes, which dragged him to one over. But just when it looked like he was on the way back, things took a turn for the worse for Woods. Following his birdie on the 10th, he carded two successive bogeys on the 11th and 12th as the wind swirled around and undid his recent hard work. However, the roller coaster continued over the next two holes. Having picked up two successive bogeys, Woods collected two successive birdies to once again position himself at one over par. Woods did manage to wrestle some sense of stability to his round over the final four holes of his round, finishing with four straight pars to leave him with a two over par 74. After the rocky opening he went through \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including four bogeys in five holes \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it is a testament to Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 fighting spirit he was able to battle back and earn a chance to compete for the green jacket over the next two days. Nobody expected Woods to be playing at the Masters this year. Following a car crash in February 2021 in which he sustained serious leg injuries, he has only appeared in public on a golf course just once, at the PNC Championship in December with his son Charlie. Then Woods used a golf cart to help him get around the course. Speculation first began to mount regarding Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 participation in the tournament when his private jet was sighted landing at an airport near Augusta last week. And a few practice rounds before the Thursday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s opening round only heightened the rumor. Woods said on Monday it would \u201a\u00c4\u00fabe a game-time decision\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on whether he plays at the Masters. He confirmed his participation later in the week, and has been the main draw at the tournament \u201a\u00c4\u00ec drawing huge swathes of patrons and media attention \u201a\u00c4\u00ec as he makes his way around the Augusta National course.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-not-biased"}]}

The House of Representatives passed the legislation which seeks to end discrimination against natural hair at work and school. The Crown (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) Act must still be approved by the Senate. President Joe Biden has urged lawmakers to swiftly pass the law. Black Americans say they are often treated unfairly at work and in schools because of their natural hair textures or protective styles like braids, knots, twists and locs. If the Crown Act becomes law, natural hair discrimination would be treated as if it were race or national origin discrimination under federal civil rights law. Until then, advocates say that employers and institutions can discriminate against black Americans based on how they style their natural hair. Adjoa B Asamoah, legislative strategist for the CROWN Coalition, praised Friday's vote in the House, but acknowledged a potential uphill battle in the Senate. \"There's the shift in policy and then there's a shift in culture,\" Ms Asamoah said. \"This is about confronting this Eurocentric standard of beauty, tackling anti-blackness, and lifting the natural African aesthetic. The diversity of Blackness is beautiful.\" The CROWN Coalition partners with more than 85 organisations to pass statewide bans on hair discrimination, and advocate for the bill nationally. Just on Thursday, the Massachusetts House of Representatives unanimously voted to advance its bill to its state senate. A third of black children in majority-white schools have faced race-based hair discrimination, according to a 2021 study by DOVE and the CROWN Coalition. The survey found 86% of children say they have experienced it by the age of 12. More than a dozen states have already passed similar laws aimed at ending hair discrimination. Just on Thursday, the Massachusetts House of Representatives unanimously voted to advance its bill to its state senate. When Chicago mother Ida Nelson was told her four-year-old son Jett's braids were prohibited by his pre-school, she says she thought administrators were joking. But when the school told her the hairstyle must be removed in order for him to go class, she decided to fight back. After months of campaigning, Ms Nelson was able to get the Jett Hawkins Act, which prohibits hair discrimination in schools, passed in Illinois. She said Friday's move to advance the national Crown Act made her feel \"vindicated\". \"When we step into our power, epic things get done,\" she added. \"This was a collective effort from everyone from four-year-olds to senior citizens coming together to say, 'No, our hair and our ability to show up as our authentic selves is not negotiable'.\" A statement from President Biden said he believed \"no person should be denied the ability to obtain a job, succeed in school or the workplace, secure housing, or otherwise exercise their rights based on a hair texture or hair style\".

Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the measure, which would bar teachers from teaching these topics to children under 10 years old. Critics say the bill will isolate LGBT youth. Proponents say it is about empowering parents on education issues. Activists have dubbed it the Don't Say Gay bill. It is officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Bill. The Republican-backed legislation passed on Tuesday. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics \"when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\". White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday decried the passing of \"hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students\". President Joe Biden and his administration are \"with LGBTQI+ students everywhere\", she wrote on Twitter. State laws that ban or constrain the discussion of LGBT life in classrooms - sometimes called \"no promo homo\" laws by critics - are not uncommon. Four US states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas - currently have laws on the books that explicitly prohibit or limit sex education to heterosexual activity. The Florida bill also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Representative Joe Harding, who sponsored the bill in Florida's statehouse, has said that the bill is simply about \"empowering parents\". Critics say that vague language in the law could result in teachers and students being prevented from discussing their lives even outside the classroom. \"This is really about making it impossible for LGBT young people to speak for themselves,\" said Nadine Smith, the executive director of advocacy group Equality Florida. Todd and Jeff Delmay - one of the first same-sex couples to get married in Florida - say this bill would make it impossible for their 11-year-old son Blake to talk freely about his dads. \"We have fought and won these battles to adopt children and to be a family and to be together,\" Todd told the BBC. \"And they are now trying to find every way in which they can erase us and our families.\" And the couple warned the bill could marginalise LGBT youth as they  come to terms with their identity. \"A child's need for acceptance in a safe space should always take precedence over some parents' belief,\" Todd said, adding that legal challenges were already under way. The Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative group that supports the bill, said in a statement last week that it was \"necessary because government schools in the US have become ideological, political and are more interested in shaping a child's politics and sexual inclinations than they are in teaching academics of reading, writing, math, and education\". Governor DeSantis - widely regarded as a possible 2024 White House contender - endorsed the bill last month, saying it was part of a wider effort to make the education system \"transparent\" to parents. The Florida bill is part of a fierce debate taking place across the US over children's education, how schools operate and what they teach. Why are certain books being banned in US?

Read her remarks as released by the White House: Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you all.  Thank you, all, very much.  Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. President.  It is the greatest honor of my life to be here with you at this moment, standing before my wonderful family, many of my close friends, your distinguished staff and guests, and the American people. Over these past few weeks, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve heard a lot from me and about me, so I hope to use this time primarily to do something that I have not had sufficient time to do, which is to extend my heartfelt thanks to the many, many people who have helped me as part of this incredible journey. I have quite a few people to thank.  And \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and as I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m sure you can imagine, in this moment, it is hard to find the words to express the depth of my gratitude. First, as always, I have to give thanks to God for delivering me as promised \u201a\u00c4\u00ec (applause) \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and for sustaining me throughout this nomination and confirmation process.  As I said at the outset, I have come this far by faith, and I know that I am truly blessed.  To the many people who have lifted me up in prayer since the nomination, thank you.  I am very grateful. Thank you, as well, Mr. President, for believing in me and for honoring me with this extraordinary chance to serve our country. Thank you also, Madam Vice President, for your wise counsel and steady guidance. And thank you to the First Lady and the Second Gentleman for the care and warmth that you have shown me and my family. I would also like to extend my thanks to each member of the Senate.  You have fulfilled the important constitutional role of providing advice and consent under the leadership of Majority Leader Schumer.  And I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m especially grateful for the work of the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Durbin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s skillful leadership.  (Applause.) As you may have heard, during the confirmation process, I had the distinct honor of having 95 personal meetings with 97 sitting senators.  (Laughter.)  And we had substantive and engaging conversations about my approach to judging and about the role of judges in the constitutional system we all love. As a brief aside, I will note that these are subjects about which I care deeply.  I have dedicated my career to public service because I love this country and our Constitution and the rights that make us free. I also understand from my many years of practice as a legal advocate, as a trial judge, and as a judge on a court of appeals that part of the genius of the constitutional framework of the United States is its design, and that the framers entrusted the judicial branch with the crucial but limited role. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve also spent the better part of the past decade hearing thousands of cases and writing hundreds of opinions.  And in every instance, I have done my level best to stay in my lane and to reach a result that is consistent with my understanding of the law and with the obligation to rule independently without fear or favor. I am humbled and honored to continue in this fashion as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, working with brilliant colleagues, supporting and defending the Constitution, and steadfastly upholding the rule of law.  (Applause.) But today, at this podium, my mission is far more modest. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m simply here to give my heartfelt thanks to the categories of folks who are largely responsible for me being here at this moment. First, of course, there is my family.  Mom and Dad, thank you not only for traveling back here on what seems like a mos- \u201a\u00c4\u00ec moment\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s notice, but for everything you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done and continue to do for me. My brother, Ketajh, is here as well.  You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve always been an inspiration to me as a model of public service and bravery, and I thank you for that. I love you all very much.  (Applause.) To my in-laws, Pamela and Gardner Jackson, who are here today, and my sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law, William and Dana, Gardie and Natalie: Thank you for your love and support. To my daughters, Talia and Leila: I bet you never thought you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d get to skip school by spending a day at the White House.  (Laughter.)  This is all pretty exciting for me as well.  But nothing has brought me greater joy than being your mother.  I love you very much.  (Applause.) Patrick, thank you for everything you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done for me over these past 25 years of our marriage.  You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done everything to support and encourage me.  And it is you who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made this moment possible.  (Applause.) Your \u201a\u00c4\u00ec your steadfast love gave me the courage to move in this direction.  I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know that I believed you when you said that I could do this, but now I do.  (Laughter and applause.)  And for that, I am forever grateful. In the family category, let me also briefly mention the huge extended family, both Patrick\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and my own, who are watching this from all over the country and the world.  Thank you for supporting me.  I hope to be able to connect with you personally in the coming weeks and months. Moving on briefly to the second category of people that warrant special recognition: those who provided invaluable support to me professionally in the decades prior to my nomination, and the many, many friends I have been privileged to make throughout my life and career. Now, I know that everyone who finds professional success thinks they have the best mentors, but I truly do.  (Laughter.)  I have three inspiring jurists for whom I had the privilege of clerking: Judge Patti Saris, Judge Bruce Selya, and, of course, Justice Stephen Breyer.  Each of them is an exceptional public servant, and I could not have had better role models for thoughtfulness, integrity, honor, and principle, both by word and deed. My clerkship with Justice Breyer, in particular, was an extraordinary gift and one for which I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve only become more grateful with each passing year.  Justice Breyer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s commitment to an independent, impartial judiciary is unflagging.  And, for him, the rule of law is not merely a duty, it is his passion.  I am daunted by the prospect of having to follow in his footsteps.  And I would count myself lucky, indeed, to be able to do so with even the smallest amount of his wisdom, grace, and joy. The exceptional mentorship of the judges for whom I clerked has proven especially significant for me during this past decade of my service as a federal judge.  And, of course, that service itself has been a unique opportunity.  For that, I must also thank President Obama, who put his faith in me by nominating me to my first judicial role on the federal district court.  (Applause.) This brings me to my colleagues and staff of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., and the D.C. Circuit: Thank you for everything.  I am deeply grateful for your wisdom and your battle-tested friendship through the years. I also want to extend a special thanks to all of my law clerks, many of whom are here today, who have carved out time and space to accompany me on this professional journey. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m especially grateful to Jennifer Gruda, who has been by my side since nearly the outset of my time on the bench \u201a\u00c4\u00ec (applause) \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and has promised \u201a\u00c4\u00ec has promised not to leave me as we take this last big step. To the many other friends that I have had the great, good fortune to have made throughout the years \u201a\u00c4\u00ec from my neighborhood growing up; from Miami Palmetto Senior High School, and especially the debate team; from my days at Harvard College, where I met my indefatigable and beloved roommates, Lisa Fairfax, Nina Coleman Simmons, and Antoinette Sequeira Coakley \u201a\u00c4\u00ec they are truly my sisters.  (Applause.) To my time at Harvard Law School and the many professional experiences that I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been blessed to have since graduation: Thank you. I have too many friends to name, but please know how much you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve meant to me and how much I have appreciated the smiles, the hugs, and the many \u201a\u00c4\u00faatta girls\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that have propelled me forward to this day. Finally, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d like to give special thanks to the White House staff and the special assistants who provided invaluable assistance in helping me to navigate the confirmation process. My trusted sherpa, Senator Doug Jones, was an absolute godsend.  (Applause.)  He was an absolute godsend.  He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not only the best storyteller you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d ever want to meet, but also unbelievably popular on the Hill, which helped a lot.  (Laughter.) I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m also standing here today in no small part due to the hard work of the brilliant folks who interact with the legislature and other stakeholders on behalf of the White House, including Louisa Terrell, Reema Dodin, and Tona Boyd, Minyon Moore, Ben LaBolt, and Andrew Bates.  (Applause.) I am also particularly grateful for the awe-inspiring leadership of White House Counsel Dana Remus.  (Applause.)  Of Paige Herwig.  Where is Paige?  (Applause.)  And Ron Klain.  (Applause.) They led an extraordinarily talented team of White House staffers in the Herculean effort that was required to ensure that I was well prepared for the rigors of this process and in record time.  Thank you all.  (Applause.) Thank you, as well, to the many, many kind-hearted people from all over this country and around the world who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve reached out to me directly in recent weeks with messages of support. I have spent years toiling away in the relative solitude of my chambers, with just my law clerks, in isolation.  So, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been somewhat overwhelming, in a good way, to recently be flooded with thousands of notes and cards and photos expressing just how much this moment means to so many people. The notes that I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve received from children are particularly cute and especially meaningful because, more than anything, they speak directly to the hope and promise of America. It has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.  (Applause.) But we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made it.  (Applause.)  We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made it, all of us.  All of us. And \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and our children are telling me that they see now, more than ever, that, here in America, anything is possible.  (Applause.) They also tell me that I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m a role model, which I take both as an opportunity and as a huge responsibility.  I am feeling up to the task, primarily because I know that I am not alone.  I am standing on the shoulders of my own role models, generations of Americans who never had anything close to this kind of opportunity but who got up every day and went to work believing in the promise of America, showing others through their determination and, yes, their perseverance that good \u201a\u00c4\u00ec good things can be done in this great country \u201a\u00c4\u00ec from my grandparents on both sides who had only a grade-school education but instilled in my parents the importance of learning, to my parents who went to racially segregated schools growing up and were the first in their families to have the chance to go to college. I am also ever buoyed by the leadership of generations past who helped to light the way: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and my personal heroine, Judge Constance Baker Motley.  (Applause.) They, and so many others, did the heavy lifting that made this day possible.  And for all of the talk of this historic nomination and now confirmation, I think of them as the true pathbreakers.  I am just the very lucky first inheritor of the dream of liberty and justice for all.  (Applause.) To be sure, I have worked hard to get to this point in my career, and I have now achieved something far beyond anything my grandparents could\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve possibly ever imagined.  But no one does this on their own.  The path was cleared for me so that I might rise to this occasion. And in the poetic words of Dr. Maya Angelou, I do so now, while \u201a\u00c4\u00fabringing the gifts\u201a\u00c4\u00b6my ancestors gave.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9  (Applause.)  I \u201a\u00c4\u00ec\u201a\u00c4\u00faI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9  (Applause.) So as I take on this new role, I strongly believe that this is a moment in which all Americans can take great pride. We have come a long way toward perfecting our union. In my family, it took just one generation to go from segregation to the Supreme Court of the United States.  (Applause.)

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. The far side of the moon, which we can never see from our vantage point on Earth, looks surprisingly different than the orb we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re used to seeing in the night sky. The near side we are so familiar with appears darker in places \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the result of the vast ancient lava flows, called lunar mare \u201a\u00c4\u00ec while the far side is covered in pock marks and craters but no mare. Why the two sides of the moon are so different has long puzzled space scientists. However, a study published last week in the journal Science Advances has come up with a new explanation for this lunar mystery. Satellite pollution is threatening to alter our view of the night sky Researchers at Brown University studied the largest impact crater on the moon, known as the South Pole-Aitken basin (or SPA). Some 1,615  miles (2,600 kilometers) wide and five miles deep, it was formed by a massive space object that slammed into the moon \u201a\u00c4\u00ec perhaps a wayward dwarf planet \u201a\u00c4\u00ec when the solar system was being formed. The researchers found that the impact that formed the basin would have created a massive plume of heat that spread the moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interior, according to the statement. That plume would have carried certain materials to the moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nearside, fueling the volcanism that created the volcanic plains. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe know that big impacts like the one that formed SPA would create a lot of heat,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Matt Jones, a doctoral candidate at Brown University and the study\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lead author, in a news release. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe question is how that heat affects the Moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interior dynamics. What we show is that under any plausible conditions at the time that SPA formed, it ends up concentrating these heat-producing elements on the nearside. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe expect that this contributed to the mantle melting that produced the lava flows we see on the surface.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The volcanic plains on the near side of the moon are home to a group of elements including potassium, rare earth elements, phosphorous among others \u201a\u00c4\u00ec  known as Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) that is rare elsewhere on the moon. The researchers conducted computer simulations of how heat generated by a giant impact would alter patterns of heat transfer in the Moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interior, and how that might redistribute KREEP material in the lunar mantle. Rare NASA lunar dust collected by Neil Armstrong on the Apollo 11 mission is up for auction According to their model, the KREEP material would have ridden the wave of heat emanating from the impact zone \u201a\u00c4\u00falike a surfer\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 whether the impact was a direct hit or just grazed the moon. As the heat plume spread beneath the moon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s crust, that material was eventually delivered to the nearside. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHow the PKT formed is arguably the most significant open question in lunar science,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jones said in the news release. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd the South Pole-Aitken impact is one of the most significant events in lunar history. This work brings those two things together, and I think our results are really exciting.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

Mark Riddell, 39, who helped wealthy parents buy their children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s way into universities, was also sentenced to two years of supervised release after his prison sentence. He was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and submit to $239,449 in forfeiture, according to Caroline Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the US Attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Office for Massachusetts. Before the sentencing, former USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic was found guilty of conspiracy and fraud for soliciting and accepting bribes to facilitate admissions of students in the scam. The college admissions scam's test-taking guru pleads guilty Riddell, a standardized test-taking savant, was paid to either ace SATs and ACTs in students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 place, or correct the students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 answers before they were handed in, prosecutors said. CNN has reached out to Riddell\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorney for comment. Riddell, one of many people caught up in the wider scheme in 2019, pleaded guilty that year to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Authorities arrested and charged Riddell, dozens of parents, college coaches and administrators in the sprawling 2019 investigation known as \u201a\u00c4\u00faOperation Varsity Blues.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Riddell agreed to a plea deal in 2019 that calls for incarceration at the low end of sentencing guidelines for the charges. Federal prosecutors have suggested a 33- to 41-month sentence, a law enforcement source told CNN that year. He had faced up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors have said Riddell was associated with William \u201a\u00c4\u00faRick\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Singer, a former college admissions coach who masterminded the scam. Singer, prosecutors said, ran two general scams: First, to cheat on standardized tests for students whose parents paid; and second, to use Singer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s connections with college sports coaches and use bribes to get paying parents\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 kids into school with fake athletic credentials. Riddell was a key player in the testing scam, prosecutors said. For years starting in 2011, Singer, the owner of a college prep business, bribed test administrators to let Riddell take tests in students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 place or correct students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 answers, prosecutors said. Singer would funnel money from a bogus charity, to which his clients donated, to test administrators at a Los Angeles private school and a public high school in Houston, authorities said. Riddell was paid $10,000 per test, prosecutors said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe was just a really smart guy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Andrew Lelling, US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said at a March 2019 news conference. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have any side information about the correct answers. He was just smart enough to get a near-perfect score on the exam or to calibrate the score.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Singer, who aided the investigation, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges, and is awaiting sentencing. US Attorney for Massachusetts Rachael Rollins said her office is \u201a\u00c4\u00fagrateful\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for the verdict in the Vavic case, part of what she called \u201a\u00c4\u00faarguably one of the largest scandals in the history of academia.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faTo say that the conduct in this case was reprehensible is an understatement,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rollins said at a press conference. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe rich, powerful and famous, dripping with privilege and entitlement, used their money and clout to steal college admissions spots from more qualified and deserving students.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Vavic accepted bribes from Singer. Vavic was accused of designating certain USC applicants as water polo recruits, thereby facilitating their admission to the university, by relying on fake athletic resumes, in exchange for bribes. He was fired in March 2019 after his allegations of his involvement in the scam were made public. On Friday, Stephen Larson, an attorney representing Vavic, said they are \u201a\u00c4\u00fadisappointed\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the jury\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision finding Vavic guilty of all of the charges against him. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are disappointed with but respectful of the jury\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Larson said. The vast majority of those charged have pleaded guilty and served out their sentences, generally measured in weeks or months. Among the more high-profile parents charged in the test-taking portion of the scheme was actress Felicity Huffman, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for paying $15,000 to the Singer to boost her older daughter\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s test scores. Huffman spent 11 days in jail in 2019. Another actress, Lori Loughlin, spent two months in prison and her husband Mossimo Giannulli spent five months in prison for paying $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake recruited athletes.

Despite a victory over the Denver Nuggets in his final game on Sunday, Vogel was unable to steer the squad into the postseason after the Lakers suffered eight consecutive defeats from March 24 to April 8. Rob Pelinka, the team\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vice president of basketball operations and General Manager, announced the decision via a news release. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have a tremendous amount of respect for Frank both on and off the court. Frank is a great coach and a good man. We will forever be grateful to him for his work in guiding us to the 2019-20 NBA championship. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is an incredibly difficult decision to make, but one we feel is necessary at this point. All of us here wish Frank and his wonderful family all the best for the future,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pelinka stated. When Lakers star forward LeBron James was asked about Vogel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s situation ahead of the team statement release, James said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI respect Frank as a coach, as a man. Our partnership that we have had over a few years here has been nothing but just candid with great conversations. This guy gives everything to the game and prepared us every single night along with his coaching staff as well. \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I got nothing but respect for him.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In Vogel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first season at the helm, he led the Lakers to a 52-19 record and the franchise\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 17th NBA title, tying the Boston Celtics for most championships in league history, during the Covid-19 pandemic-shortened 2019-2020 during the Covid-19 bubble season in Orlando, Florida. Last season, Los Angeles lost to the eventual Western Conference champion, Phoenix Suns, in the first round of the playoffs. Vogel compiled an 127-98 regular season and 18-9 postseason record with the Lakers. Overall, the 48-year-old has a 431-389 regular season record, 48-39 in postseason in 11 seasons with the Lakers, Orlando Magic and Indiana Pacers. Vogel had signed a contract extension last year to keep him at the Lakers until 2023, but the team struggled this season, due in part to injuries. Star players LeBron James and Anthony Davis both spent time on the sidelines as a lack of consistency proved ultimately fatal for Vogel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reign. Vogel seemed unsure about his future with the team when asked about his job on Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been told sh*t and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m going to enjoy tonight\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s game, celebrate what these young guys did in terms of scratching and clawing and getting back in this game and getting a W, and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll deal with tomorrow tomorrow,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he told reporters.

Prosecutors say the men, some of whom are alleged militia members, targeted Gretchen Whitmer over Covid rules she imposed early in the pandemic. Lawyers for the accused say that the government's evidence is flimsy and have indicated an entrapment defence. The closely-watched trial is expected to last about six weeks. According to the FBI, which says it interrupted the plot 17 months ago, the men had planned to blow up a bridge near the governor's vacation home, then kidnap her and put her on a \"treason trial\". Ultimately 14 alleged plotters were arrested in late 2020. Six of the group were charged in a federal court. The other eight face separate state charges. Two of the men who faced federal charges have already pleaded guilty and are expected to testify against the remaining four at the trial. The undercover FBI agents that infiltrated the group are also expected to testify, and have been forced by a judge to reveal their real names over the objections of prosecutors. \"Making it crystal clear to the jury and the public that inside the courtroom, nothing is undercover and everything is out in the open will best ensure fairness during trial and eventual acceptance and respect for whatever the jury ultimately decides,\" Chief US District Judge Robert Jonker ruled on Thursday. Suspects Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, and Brandon Caserta, 33, are from Michigan, while Barry Croft, 46, is from the state of Delaware. All four are facing charges of kidnapping conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mr Croft and Mr Harris are also facing charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. Prosecutors say they will prove the men took specific steps towards achieving their plan, including travelling to the governor's home, testing explosives and training for combat against Gov Whitmer's security team. On Tuesday, around 100 potential jurors were indirectly asked about their personal politics, including whether they approve of Gov Whitmer and whether they view the 6 January Capitol riots as an \"insurrection\" or a \"legitimate political protest\". Rules ban lawyers from directly asking about political affiliation. The juror pool has been pulled from counties in northern Michigan, an area that skews Republican. The time of the FBI's swoop came as Ms Whitmer's lockdown orders drew thousands of protesters to the state capitol, where many legally entered government buildings with semi-automatic rifles and other firearms.

Eric Greitens alleged he was physically abusive toward his children and her, according to court documents filed Monday. Greitens resigned as governor in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct and has been trying to mount a political comeback in his pursuit of a US Senate seat. A number of his GOP primary rivals called on Monday for him to drop out of the race following the abuse allegations made by his ex-wife. Sheena Greitens, who now resides in Texas with the former couple\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s two children, said she grew so afraid of her former husband that she sought to limit his access to weapons and began sleeping in her children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s room out of concern for their safety, according to an affidavit filed in the Circuit Court of Boone County in Missouri, as part of her effort to have a custody case moved to Texas. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn early June 2018, I became afraid for my safety and that of our children at our home, which was fairly isolated, due to Eric\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unstable and coercive behavior,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, according to court records from the ongoing custody battle. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis behavior included physical violence toward our children, such as cuffing our then three-year-old son across the face at the dinner table in front of me and yanking him around by his hair.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sheena Greitens said she and others were so concerned about Eric Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 behavior that they limited his access to firearms on three occasions.

In a statement, Eric Greitens denied the allegations. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBeing a father is the joy of my life and my single most important responsibility,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI will continue to love and care for my beautiful sons with all of my being, and that includes fighting for the truth and against completely fabricated, baseless allegations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Monday, his attorney asked the judge to seal the custody case. In her affidavit, Sheena Greitens laid out a series of allegations of verbal threats and physical abuse against both her and their children. She detailed how Eric Greitens allegedly threatened to use his political ties to tarnish his ex-wife\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reputation. In one instance, she claimed Eric Greitens had \u201a\u00c4\u00faknocked me down and confiscated my cell phone, wallet, and keys so that I was unable to call for help or extricate myself and our children,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the court filing. In another 2019 incident, one of the children returned from a visit with Eric Greitens with a swollen face, bleeding gums and a loose tooth, according to her court filing. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said Dad had hit him; however, Eric said they were roughhousing and it had been an accident,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sheena Greitens said in her affidavit. At one point, Sheena Greitens said she tried to flee with the children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen I told Eric about my plans, he threatened to come to the airport and have me arrested for kidnapping and child abuse, saying that because of his authority as a former Governor who had supported law enforcement, the police would support him and not believe me, and I would lose our children,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the affidavit. Sheena and Eric Greitens divorced in 2020. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 campaign manager Dylan Johnson said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHis ex-wife is engaged in a last-ditch attempt to vindictively destroy her ex-husband. Though she knows that the press will viciously repeat her false allegations, Eric has always been a great Dad, who loves his boys and has always put them first, and that is why he is filing for full custody of his children.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In a Tuesday statement, Sheena Greitens stood by her sworn affidavit and said she would provide evidence and documentation if the court requests it. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMy only interest is what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best for my two children, and for the last four years, I have gone to great lengths to keep these family matters private to protect them,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in her statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI am not interested in litigating this matter anywhere other than the courtroom.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Eric Greitens has been vying for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Roy Blunt. The crowded primary also includes US Rep. Vicky Hartzler, State Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long and others. In the wake of the latest allegations, Hartzler, Schmitt and Long called on Greitens to drop out of the race. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have one thing that I want to say: real men never abuse women and children. Period. End of story,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hartzler said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time for Eric to get out of the Senate race and to get professional help.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Schmitt called the abuse allegations \u201a\u00c4\u00fasickening,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 adding, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe behavior described in this affidavit is cause for Eric Greitens to be in prison, not on the ballot for U.S. Senate. He should end his campaign immediately.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Long said he was \u201a\u00c4\u00fashocked and appalled\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by what was in the affidavit, adding of Greitens: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe is clearly unfit to represent the state of Missouri in the United States Senate. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no way he can stay in this race.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, on Monday became the highest-ranking Republican to say Greitens should leave the race. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who called on Greitens to resign as governor in 2018 and has endorsed Hartzler in the Senate primary, also called for him to drop out, expressing concern that Republicans could lose the seat if Greitens were the nominee. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had no comment on Greitens on Monday. Walking in silence without saying anything, the Kentucky Republican would not respond to questions about whether the Senate candidate should drop out. On Tuesday, Blunt \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the senator Greitens is vying to replace \u201a\u00c4\u00ec also said Greitens should step aside if the allegations against him are true. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the statements filed with the court are true, he should not be a candidate for the Senate,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Blunt told CNN. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 stunning fall from grace in 2018 came as he faced calls for impeachment from the GOP-controlled state legislature and a criminal charge \u201a\u00c4\u00ec invasion of privacy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec related to a 2015 affair, in which his former hairdresser alleged he tied her up, coerced her into oral sex and threatened to blackmail her with partially nude photos to cover up their affair. Greitens admitted to the affair but refuted the blackmail claim. He was separately charged with another felony \u201a\u00c4\u00ec tampering with computer data \u201a\u00c4\u00ec for allegedly misusing a veterans charity\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s donor list for his 2016 gubernatorial campaign. The criminal charges against Greitens were dropped. And a former FBI agent investigating the blackmail allegations was later indicted for perjury and tampering with physical evidence. When a Missouri ethics panel investigated Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 campaign misconduct, it found no evidence of wrongdoing but fined the campaign for failing to report in-kind contributions. Greitens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 accuser never recanted her sexual misconduct allegations. Sheena Greitens said in her affidavit filed Monday that Eric Greitens admitted to her that he took the photo that resulted in the invasion of privacy charge, but \u201a\u00c4\u00fahe threatened that I would be exposed to legal jeopardy if I ever disclosed that fact to anyone.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She also alleged that in the spring and summer of 2018, \u201a\u00c4\u00faEric repeatedly threatened to kill himself unless I provided specific public support to him.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Earlier this year, the former governor told CNN that he did \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 nothing wrong with his former hairdresser and claimed that he resigned for his two children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt was the thing that I had to do for the people who I love the most, particularly for my boys, given those tremendous lies and the tremendous pressure that was on my kids,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. But Sheena Greitens pushed back on that explanation in her court filing, saying their young children were \u201a\u00c4\u00faunaware of the scandal, and I would like them to remain so until they are older.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She added: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have privately entreated Eric to stop introducing false and misleading information about our marriage and divorce into the public in his quest for political office,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to her court filing. Before the scandals, Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, was a rising star in the Republican Party. In the Senate race, he has completely aligned himself with former President Donald Trump. He has spread the lie that Trump won the 2020 presidential election, said he would not support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for Senate GOP leader and recently visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Florida resort, where he met with Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who advises his Senate campaign.

She went viral earlier this week after a bizarre exchange during the selection proceedings when a woman told her she had a scheduling conflict and couldn\u2019t serve on the jury because she was both married and had \"a sugar daddy.\" Scherer was a prosecutor for over a decade before joining Florida\u2019s 17th Judicial Circuit in 2012, appointed by then-Gov.

She also serves on the boards of directors for both Voices For Children and St. Anthony Catholic School Friends For Education, according to her court bio. She is a volunteer faculty member at the school and was named a judicial advocate of the year in 2013. That year, she lambasted child welfare authorities and a local foster operator after a 4-year-old boy in the foster system was found dead at his biological mother's apartment, according to CBS Miami. The mother had a history of mental illness and had lost custody but was attempting to regain it \u2013 and despite Scherer's instructions, the foster operator allegedly sent the child to her home for an unsupervised visit. Scherer attended Florida State University for a bachelor\u2019s in English and went to law school at the University of Miami.

She filed for divorce the next day, although the Sun-Sentinel reported at the time that they had already been separated for months. Court records show the charges were later dropped after he completed a drug court program. In 2014, she signed off on a controversial search warrant that resulted in an unarmed drug-dealing suspect suffering fatal gunshot wounds while standing in his own kitchen, according to the Broward-Palm Beach New Times. Police also killed his dog, the Sun-Sentinel reported, and he was charged with \"resisting arrest without violence\" but died 11 days later, before his case ever made it to court.

He could face the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. More than 120 of the first 160 to appear before Scherer Monday were dismissed. The woman with the \"sugar daddy\" excuse, identified only by her last name, Bristol, was among them. \"I'm married, and I have my sugar daddy,\" she told Scherer, in an apparent excuse as to why she didn\u2019t have time to serve on the jury. \"I see him every day.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"OK.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A New York State judge died by suicide Tuesday weeks after federal agents searched his home. John L. Michalski, an acting justice of the state Supreme Court, was found dead at his home in Amherst, New York, a suburb outside of Buffalo, Tuesday before noon, his lawyer, Terrence Connors, confirmed to The New York Times. Connors said the 61-year-old died by suicide, describing his loss as a \"tragedy,\" adding that \"it would be difficult to find a justice who was more respected\" than Michalski. NOTORIOUS NY MOB HIT MAN WHO KILLED 2 ESCAPES FEDERAL CUSTODY IN FLORIDA Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the court system, told the Times that Amherst police advised officials about Michalski\u2019s death but declined to provide more details, referring questions to law enforcement. According to his official bio on the state court website, Michalski was named to the Court of Claims in 2006 and as an acting state Supreme Court justice later that year. (Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images) Citing two government sources, The Buffalo News reported that law enforcement executed a search warrant on Michalski\u2019s home last month in connection to a federal investigation into the judge and his wife over potential tax crimes related to an online retail clothing and jewelry business operated out of the residence. Neither Michalski nor his wife had been charged in connection to the probe. Federal authorities had also continued to investigate Michalski over his close friendship with Peter Gerace Jr., the owner of Pharaoh\u2019s Gentlemen\u2019s Club in Cheektowaga, outside of Buffalo. The Miami Herald previously described Gerace as the nephew of reputed Buffalo mob boss Joseph A. Todaro Jr. Peter Gerace Jr. was arrested last year in southern Florida on federal conspiracy to commit sex tracking, bribery and drug distribution charges. (Broward Sheriff's Office) Michalski reportedly attempted suicide once before in February 2021 by lying on train tracks at an Amtrak station in the Buffalo suburb of Depew. A freight train passed over him, causing serious leg injuries. He took a leave of absence from the $210,900-a-year seat on the bench but resumed work in January of this year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The judge first tried to kill himself on the same day Gerace was arrested in Florida on federal conspiracy to commit sex tracking, bribery and drug distribution charges. The federal superseding indictment did not name Michalski, but it did accuse a federal DEA agent named Joseph Bongiovanni of using his position to shield friends and associates, including Gerace, from criminal investigations in the Buffalo-area. Gerace has since been transferred back to the Western District of New York.

After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives. Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have \"enormous consequences\". And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas. In a statement, he said Europe had \"deliberately exempted\" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured \"any other way\" at the moment. Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. \"Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,\" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine. Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are \"moving very, very fast\" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are \"now very much on the table\". He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%. Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be \"diligent and not overnight\", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy. An immediate change would \"basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,\" he said, adding: \"It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself.\" Mr Johnson also announced a further \u00a3175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials. Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday. During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was \"processing thousands\" and would be \"very generous\" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks. The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry. Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict. But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a \"complete mess\" and the government must establish a \"simple route to sanctuary\", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was \"not doing anywhere near enough\" to help refugees. More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Home Office is in a \"complete mess\" over how Ukrainians can get to the UK Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals. In recent days, the government has announced asset freezes and travel bans on a number of oligarchs - but has faced accusations of being too slow to sanction those with links to President Putin. The bill will set up a new register that will mean foreign owners of UK property must declare and verify their identities with Companies House. MPs are expected to vote through all stages of the bill in a single sitting. Labour said it would support the legislation, but wanted the proposed timeframe for property owners to register to be cut from six months to 28 days.

Trump: A First Historical Assessment.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Twitter and former President Donald Trump are together in the news again. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk bought more than 9% of Twitter\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stock and secured a board seat at the social media company, fueling speculation about his potential influence on the platform. Musk, a strong advocate of free speech who has used Twitter to spread disinformation and mock politicians, has already suggested he would work with the company to make \u201a\u00c4\u00fasignificant improvements,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 although it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unclear what those plans might be and whether they will come to fruition. Meanwhile, some conservatives are calling on Musk to allow Trump back on the platform after the former President was permanently suspended two days after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol \u201a\u00c4\u00fadue to the risk of further incitement of violence.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow that @ElonMusk is Twitter\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s largest shareholder, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time to lift the political censorship. Oh \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 and BRING BACK TRUMP!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 tweeted Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert. Twitter spokespeople have said that management and employees make those policy decisions, not the board. The potential for Trump to regain access to Twitter could have a significant impact on the 2024 Republican primaries, assuming the former President is planning to run again. Twitter was integral to Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s political success, and if his accounts are restored, he would have immense leverage to secure the Republican presidential nomination and enhance his position in a general election. Opinion: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner go their own way on January 6 Six months after he was suspended from Twitter, I convened a meeting with the former President and a group of other historians working on a book about his time in office. Responding to a question about his Twitter usage, Trump seemed to gloss over the blow of losing access to his social media accounts, saying that he found issuing news releases on his website \u201a\u00c4\u00fafar more elegant.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s undeniable that Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presence in the public square has significantly diminished since he was suspended from several social media platforms. And months after our meeting, Trump submitted a court filing to try to get his Twitter account reinstated (a judge rejected his argument and granted Twitter\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s motion to move the lawsuit filed in Florida to the Northern District Court of California). Meanwhile, his efforts to build an alternative social media platform have so far struggled. Trump depended on Twitter to communicate directly to the public in an informal and unedited way. Though we still don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know how much was scripted, and whether certain tweets were written by White House staffers, Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Twitter account was a source of constant commentary. He used the platform to attack his opponents, spread disinformation to his political advantage and taunt foreign leaders such as North Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Kim Jong Un. But more important for Trump was the way that he used Twitter to shape the 24-hour news cycle. Whether or not he was self-conscious about his strategy, Trump had an innate feel for the way modern media is drawn to controversy, provocative statements and sensational stories. With a willingness to communicate without any guardrails, Trump was able to shape the news of the day with just a few words on Twitter. When you are a powerful leader willing to say just about anything \u201a\u00c4\u00ec be that outlandish statements, incendiary words or simply nonsensical comments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it is a safe bet that media coverage will follow. Remember covfefe? Sign up for CNN Opinion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Indeed, the campaign to delegitimize the 2020 election relied in part on Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s repeated Twitter blasts that fueled his narrative. What we saw on January 6 was a real mob that came together through the world of social media, chanting slogans that grew out of Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Twitter feed as they stormed Capitol Hill. If Trump is going to make a political comeback in 2024, Twitter could prove to be a game-changer for him. Without access to this medium, it will be enormously difficult for him to recreate the strategy that propelled him to the White House in 2016, especially with a new generation of Trumpian Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ready to stir up controversy and feed red meat to the base. If Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presence on the board does somehow lead to a change in policy, the Republican primaries \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and the future of the country \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will likely look very different.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-not-biased"}]}

Source: Johns Hopkins University and national public health agencies Figures last updated: 5 July 2022, 08:59 BST The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available. Deaths are falling in many areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Data on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. Using this metric, researchers from the Lancet medical journal suggest that more than 18 million people may have died because of Covid up to the end of 2021. That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease. Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period. Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses. According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%. Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant. Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. Asia Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture. North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province. In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions. Europe Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic. In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. North America The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. Latin America Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously. Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June. Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people. Africa Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low. According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country. Middle East Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year. The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases. In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. Oceania Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus. Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths. In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years. Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies. When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult. Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic. The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Figures for France are for the mainland only and include both suspected and confirmed cases.

A San Francisco jury on Monday found a police officer facing four counts of assault and battery charges not guilty after four days of deliberation. District Attorney (DA) Chesa Boudin, who first announced charges against San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Officer Terrance Stangel in December 2020, was accused of withholding evidence in the case earlier this year. Stangel was accused of unnecessarily beating a Black man named Dacari Spiers with a baton in October 2019, breaking Spiers' wrist and leg, while responding to a domestic violence call. \"We are thankful that the jury was able to see through the dishonesty of the DA\u2019s office in this case and see it for what it was \u2013 unjust and unsupported,\" Stangel's attorney, Nicole Pifari, said in a statement Monday evening following the verdict in a San Francisco Superior Court. \"Everyone should be deeply concerned about this case, about this District Attorney, and about the rule of law in San Francisco.\" Police officer Terrance Stangel, second from the left, enters Department 27 at the Hall of Justice with his attorney Nicole Pifari on Monday, March 7, 2022, in San Francisco, California.

It is unclear if prosecutors will refile the charge. SAN FRANCISCO DA CHESA BOUDIN ACCUSED OF WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE IN OFFICER MISCONDUCT CASE Boudin thanked the jury \"for their careful consideration of this case over the course of four full days of deliberation\" in a Monday statement. \"We respect the jury process, although we remain disappointed that police accountability remains so elusive and difficult to achieve,\" he said. \"I am committed to continuing to hold those who commit harm accountable \u2013 regardless of the uniform they may wear or the badge they may carry.

Hayashi told Caffese\u00a0that she never disclosed information from a female witness who claimed to see Spiers beating a woman before Stangel hit him with a baton and that she feared she would be fired if she did, according to the outlet. SAN FRANCISCO DA BOUDIN'S OFFICE \u2018THREATENED\u2019 INVESTIGATOR MULTIPLE TIMES TO WITHHOLD EVIDENCE: TRANSCRIPT Pifari filed a motion to dismiss the case on Jan. 24, citing \"prosecutorial misconduct\" and \"deceptive\" methods by the DA's office. The memo in support of the motion to dismiss filed by Pifari includes a transcript from the witness to 911, which is what initially led police to respond to the 2019 incident. Police officer Terrance Stangel, center, and lawyer Nicole Pifari enter the courtroom at the Hall of Justice on Feb. 8, 2022, in San Francisco, California. (Gabrielle Lurie/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) The call transcript reads as follows: \"I would like to report \u2026 I think it's called domestic violence or something because, um, there's this guy who is beating up on this girl. \u2026 He's like, um, holding her like by the neck, like draggin' her by the neck. \u2026 She was trying to get away, then he grabbed, and then he got her again.\" A second witness described similar details in a statement, including in Pifari's motion. Boudin prematurely labeled one of the witnesses as a \"racially-biased Karen,\" according to FOX 2 San Francisco. \"The citizens of San Francisco should be asking themselves why Chesa Boudin would come out of the starting gate [labeling] the two African American women who called 911 as \u2018Karen Callers,\u2019\" Pifari said in her statement. \"\u2026 If Chesa Boudin is willing to break and bend the law as many times as his office did in this case, everyone should be afraid.\" Spiers filed a federal lawsuit against the city of San Francisco in February 2020, which states that he was \"consoling his girlfriend about the theft\" of her wallet before the attack, \"and the two were leaning against the car and were engaged in hugging and kissing each other.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The lawsuit then alleges that two or more officers approached Spiers at that moment and abruptly grabbed him. Spiers and his girlfriend begged the officers to stop, and he was left with \"horrendous blows with his hands and wrists, which caused severe injuries, including a severely broken wrist,\" the complaint states. Spiers accused the city of violating his civil rights. On March 2, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted Spiers' motion to sanction the city and county of San Francisco for withholding evidence from Spiers. Video footage of the incident released last year shows a chaotic scene in which Spiers questions officers' use of force, saying he didn't do anything. Stangel was acquitted of felony charges, including battery with serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon and assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury. He faced up to seven years in prison, according to the Chronicle. Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

There were more than 100 people at a venue popular among celebrities, and everyone was singing in Welsh, at the top of their lungs. And if you asked me two years ago whether it was possible to fill a swanky cocktail bar in Los Angeles full of figures from sports, business and creative industries, to come together to celebrate Wales, I would have said 'no way'. But then came Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. It was actor and comedian Humphrey Ker who had the idea to buy a football club, and he quickly persuaded Rob and Ryan to jump on board. Humphrey searched far and wide for a club, until the three finally set their sights on Wrexham AFC. These days, when any of the three are asked 'why Wrexham?' they always respond 'why not Wrexham?' And it is this affirmative and ambitious attitude they share for the world's third oldest football club that has propelled Wrexham to increased success over the last 12 months, with play-offs now very much on the horizon. They quickly brought on board Fleur Robinson as chief executive officer. Fleur had helped take Burton Albion from non-league football to two seasons in the second tier championship. And together, their ethos has been clear: to help grow the club at home and abroad, while protecting the deep cultural heritage of Wrexham. What they perhaps didn't foresee is that the story would become much bigger than Wrexham, and would quickly extend to Wales and the Welsh language. Rob and Ryan have become unofficial ambassadors to Wales, a role that Rob says he didn't expect, but is most definitely embracing. \"A year ago I don't think either of us would have guessed this would happen, but we fully accept the responsibility with great honour,\" he says. The Welcome to Wrexham documentary team, who are unveiling a series on FX later this year, is capturing the entire journey. When I recorded the promo to announce the show, it became very clear to me that both Rob and Ryan had a deep respect for the Welsh language. They chose to include Welsh in the promo, and it was immediately noticeable to me when I first met the guys, that their investment in Welsh sport and culture is genuine. Fast-forward a year, and my experience as a Welsh person living in the US has changed immensely. A year ago I found myself constantly explaining where Wales is, and that Welsh is a different language, I am now often greeted by \"oh Wales, as in Wrexham\" when I first meet Americans. Rob, particularly, has really thrown himself into being an honorary Welshman, and is consistently surprising the Welsh speaking community with his language skills. \"It's a really difficult language to learn,\" says Rob. \"But I hope to keep going and one day speak it fluently enough to be able to tell jokes in Welsh.\" Every year, the Welsh government in North America holds events to celebrate St David's Day. They are often held on the east coast, where there is a larger number of Welsh diaspora, so it was exciting to hear that this year, the government was to hold an event on Friday, 4 March, in Los Angeles. It was billed as a \"celebration of all things Welsh and Wrexham AFC\" with the now very Welsh Rob McElhenney invited as the special guest. The venue, The Pendry, secured by Efe Sokol, head of the Welsh government's Northeast region of North America, was suitably glamorous. Guests walked the red carpet outside, to a beautifully decorated inside space complete with mannequins sporting the three Wrexham AFC kits, as Welsh musician Tom Lewis greeted them with traditional Welsh song. The turnout was incredible. Members of the creative industry in Hollywood, people from the world of sport, and Welsh expats from across America came together. \"The creative industry and sport are the two priorities for the Welsh government in North America, and it is so important that we can bring everyone together, make new connections, and make new relationships to help build the profile of Wales here and create more opportunities and jobs for Wales and Welsh people,\" said Eoghan O'Regan, deputy head of the Welsh government in the US. The event was also an opportunity for Welsh language media to demonstrate that Wales can perform on a global stage, and that Wales is open for co-productions and partnerships. I managed to catch up with S4C's newly appointed chief executive Sian Doyle, who flew in to attend the event. Sian boasts extensive experience in the telecommunications and retail sectors in the UK and North America, and will be focused on catapulting S4C into the global media market, empowering talent in Wales, and bringing Welsh language to the world stage. \"It's so wonderful to be here,\" said Sian. \"There is genuine goodwill and warmth towards Wales and the Welsh language. \"It is such a great opportunity to bring Wales to Los Angeles, and Los Angeles to Wales, and to create really valuable partnerships for Wales,\" said Sian. She addressed the audience along with Dr Zowie Hay, head of the Welsh government in North America, who spoke of how Wrexham AFC has played such an integral role in raising the profile of Wales and the Welsh language over the last year. Wrexham AFC executive director Humphrey Ker also gave a small speech before introducing the man who most definitely stole the show, Rob McElhenney. Prior to the event, many people had asked whether Rob would say something in Welsh, and Rob did not disappoint. He began by addressing everyone in Welsh - as he had done when he first walked out and spoke in front of fans on the Racecourse stadium back in November. After wishing everyone a good evening, and delivering a couple of lines, Rob switched to English and entertained the room with stories of Pennsylvania, Wrexham, and his realisation that story of Wrexham is now far bigger than he ever thought it would be. This video can not be played Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought the National League club in February 2021 \"At one point I'm just in the middle of California, looking at the ocean enjoying my life, and the next I am right in the middle of Welsh culture,\" says Rob. \"And suddenly I realised that this is a far bigger movement, it's not just about football.\" The room was very visibly moved by Rob's words, and the emotion was real and shared by all, Welsh or not, as he finished his speech by shouting \"Cymru am byth!\" before leading the crowd in Welsh song. For me, it was a huge moment of personal pride. My father's family is from Wrexham, so I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to be part of the Wrexham story in a small way, and to have got to know Rob and Ryan a little, and watch Rob get better in Welsh. I remember growing up and experiencing those incidents that many of us have shared, on public transport or in a social setting, and hearing visitors to Wales say loudly that I was only speaking Welsh to my sister or friends so that they wouldn't understand. I was so lucky to have grown up with a mother who, despite being English, instilled in me a pride and passion for the Welsh language, and encouraged my siblings and I to speak Welsh. As I have moved through my career and became an international journalist living in the US, I made a firm decision to prioritise Welsh language broadcasting. Some of the proudest moments of my career have been delivering the American story to S4C Newyddion, BBC Radio Cymru and online audiences. As the Welsh language media, I believe, we should be pushing boundaries and creating headlines in Welsh. Rob and Ryan have brought the Welsh language to the world and began to break down barriers. When their documentary series Welcome to Wrexham comes out later this year, I doubt there will be a single person who hasn't heard of Wrexham and of Wales. Rob's love of the country is real, and it is inspiring others to feel the same - and that was most certainly felt at the event on Friday night. I sat down and chatted with Rob during a quiet moment, and for the first time, I was able to put a question to him entirely in Welsh: \"Rob, how is your Welsh language learning going?\" I asked. And without missing a beat, Rob responded in perfect Welsh: \"I love the Welsh language, and I'm working on improving.\" And I thought to myself, it won't surprise me if next year, Rob really is standing up here in front of everyone and telling jokes in Welsh.

Attorney General Letitia James requested he be fined $10,000 (\u00a37,650) per day until he complies. A judge previously ordered Mr Trump to provide the files as part of Ms James's probe into the Trump Organization. The former president's lawyer called the motion \"frivolous\". The New York attorney general opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans. Mr Trump and his family have denied wrongdoing and the former president has called the inquiry a \"witch hunt\". In February, a judge ruled that Mr Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr, 44, and daughter Ivanka Trump, 40, must answer questions under oath in the New York investigation into their business practices. They appealed the order to appear but did not object to a separate part of the ruling that the former president comply with a subpoena \"seeking documents and information\". Those were meant to be produced by 31 March. In court documents filed on Thursday, the New York attorney general said Mr Trump has not produced the requested documents and has raised objections \"based on grounds such as overbreadth, burden, and lack of particularity\". \"The judge's order was crystal clear: Donald J Trump must comply with our subpoena and turn over relevant documents to my office,\" Ms James said in a statement. Ms James has repeatedly blamed Mr Trump for creating unnecessary delays in the legal process. Mr Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, said in a statement sent to Reuters that: \"We are prepared to adamantly oppose the frivolous and baseless motion filed by the attorney general's office. \"Our client has consistently complied with the many discovery requests served by the attorney general's office over the years.\" The civil case is separate to a Manhattan criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's practices.

The pioneering procedure was done to save his life, but could also revolutionise the field of organ transplantation, they hope. The donated thymus tissue should help stop his body rejecting the new heart. Months on from the surgery, tests reveal Easton is progressing well. The thymus tissue is working, meaning his body is building critical immune cells which might ultimately reduce or even eliminate the need for him to take lifelong anti-rejection drugs. One of his doctors, Joseph Turek from Duke University Hospital, said: \"We are very excited about it. This concept of tolerance has always been the holy grail in transplantation, and we are now on the doorstep. \"This has the potential to change the face of solid organ transplantation in the future.\" The thymus gland helps the development of T-cells, which fight foreign substances in the body. It teaches these immune cells what is \"self\" and what isn't, and therefore what can be attacked. Giving Easton cultured thymus tissue from the same donor who gave him a heart, should help his body adopt the new tissues, his doctors believe. Easton was born with a weak heart as well as problems with his immune system. He spent his first seven months in hospital - some of it on life support - and needed numerous heart operations. as well as treatment for recurrent infections that his body was unable to fight on its own. His mother, Kaitlyn Sinnamon, recalls: \"It helped some, but it was basically a band aid for us to make it through transplant.\" His doctors applied to the medical regulatory body, the FDA, to carry out an experimental type of transplant that hadn't been done in combination before, as far as they knew. Since Easton needed a new heart and, independently, a new thymus gland, the FDA granted approval for the procedures that went ahead in August 2021, when Easton was six months old. Dr Turek said: \"This was very serendipitous. We had the expertise to do both. \"The work we had done in the laboratory was based around using thymus along with heart transplantation in order to develop tolerance - so basically retraining the immune system and having the thymus of the same donor and heart grow up together. \"We thought this was an opportunity for Easton. This could be applied to all solid organs down the road potentially if this works.\" Much more research is needed before then, including checking if it is viable to remove and replace the thymus in people who have one that is already fully functioning. The medical team plan to wean Easton off the immunosuppressive drugs at some point, to see how he progresses. Kaitlyn said: \"I hope that as he gets older he gets to be proud of his scars, and know that he not only got to save his own life, but got to save other people's lives as well.\" US man gets pig heart in world-first transplant Pig kidney transplanted into brain-dead person Duke Health\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined products with effect from 5 December. An oil price cap approved by Western allies in December also aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (\u00a348) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it would cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. \"Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (\u00a340) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere.\" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (\u00a3140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021, more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports went to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producers cut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022, according to EU figures. In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states are increasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, \"there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe\", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. \"This will be a problem for Germany, particularly.\" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

Needless to say, it did not go well.  His contraption didn't fly and he was made to fix the fence. \"I was brought up in a way that I guess challenged me scientifically... I was always told that nothing's impossible,\" he says. Perhaps he got a bit ahead of himself during his childhood in Sydney, but as an adult Mr Mayman, has built innovative machines that really do fly. After selling his online listings business Mr Mayman developed a jetpack, which in 2015 he flew around the Statue of Liberty. But, since 2018, he has been working on a different kind of project, one he thinks will have more commercial opportunities. Called the Speeder, his new machine will be like a flying motorbike. It will take off vertically, fly at high speeds, but be compact enough to fit in the back of a pick-up truck. Speeder is just one of many flying machine projects under way at the moment. There are currently hundreds of EVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft in development, with engineers hoping to create a new era of cheap, quiet air transportation. But Mr Mayman's machine is very different from those aircraft. Instead of being powered by batteries and electric engines, his Speeder uses four small jet engines, which run on aviation fuel. That might seem like a step backwards in technology, but for the customers Mr Mayman has in mind, only liquid fuel will do. He says the military, emergency services and the offshore energy industry want a fast, compact aircraft that can carry a significant weight. For that, you need jet fuel, as it stores 20 times the energy of batteries for a given weight. Or in other words, to supply the power needed, batteries would be too heavy. \"If you want to carry a certain payload, and you want that aircraft to have a certain range and certain speed, the only way to do that with current technology is, with turbine engines.\" Mr Mayman explains. The Speeder idea emerged from work with the US Navy, who were interested in a jetpack for use by the Navy's special forces, the Seals. \"As is so often the case in aviation, you start with one set of specifications, and fairly quickly, you end up with an entirely different set of specs,\" he explains. \"They initially wanted something that would carry a payload of 210 pounds (95kg), not far into the project that morphed to nearly 300 pounds (135kg). And they wanted it to be possible to train somebody literally in 10 minutes,\" Mr Mayman says. None of that was possible with his existing jetpack product - something bigger and easier to fly would be needed, so the Speeder project was born. Some of the jetpack technology was helpful on the new project, but much of it had to be developed from scratch. To simplify things, while on the jetpack the direction of thrust is controlled mechanically by the pilot on the Speeder the angle of the four jet turbines is controlled by an electronic flight control system. The key part of that system is bespoke software that understands the physics of the four very powerful jets. This means that when the pilot lifts-off or turns, the Speeder can angle its jets to make that happen. Mr Mayman says that owners will not necessarily need a pilots licence, as the Speeder's flight control systems are doing much of the work to keep the aircraft steady. \"It's effectively AI (artificial intelligence) - if you want to call it that - that understands what the vehicle is going to need... so it can start instructing the engines to be spooling up or spooling down,\" says Mr Mayman. It's that aspect of artificial intelligence that interests Sajal Kissoon, a research assistant in gas turbine technology at Cranfield University's aerospace centre. \"The important enabler for this [the Speeder] is the use of AI to assist control. This, in itself, is a very exciting advancement,\" she explains. \"What if the Speeder faces unusual weather conditions, or unusual wind conditions, or an unusual manoeuvre by the pilot? I think AI would be essential to assist control,\" Ms Kissoon adds. More technology of business: Mr Mayman is hopeful that the Speeder will eventually be used to transport cargo. Piloted by remote control, or autonomously he thinks there will be demand particularly from the armed forces or emergency services. With a top speed of around 200mph and a flight time up to 60 minutes, Mr Mayman says it could get essential supplies for the military, or emergency services, very quickly to where they need to be. In cargo mode, where it is piloted remotely, it will be able to go even faster, perhaps at 500mph and carry 450kg. Being compact and able to fly in all sorts of weather conditions, he thinks it has the potential to be more versatile than a helicopter. But before you get too excited at the prospect of ditching the bus and hopping on a Speeder to work, Mr Mayman says it is unlikely to fly through cities. \"We make noise, we're incredibly powerful, we're incredibly small. I don't think there's necessarily a need within the urban air mobility space for an aircraft that can be the size of your kitchen table.\" Crucially, a lot more testing still needs to be done before the Speeder is delivered to any customer. A third full-size prototype (called the P2) is being prepared for flight at test range about two hours east of Los Angeles. There will be enough space there for the Speeder to be put through its paces. A key phase will also come late next year, when the company hopes to start the certification process. The company estimates that will take 12 months. If all goes to plan, the Speeder might be available for sale in late 2024 or 2025, although the military might be able to start flying it earlier, according to Mr Mayman. Unsurprisingly, all of his engineers want to be the first to fly the machine out in the desert, but Mr Mayman is saving that thrill for himself. \"It's pretty much the main reason they work here. So, I have got a long queue of folks waiting to test fly this thing. But I'll be pulling rank,\" he says. And hopefully for Mr Mayman, this time he will not have to fix any fences.

Guy Reffitt, 49, from Texas, was convicted of five charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and interfering with police in a riot. The case was being closely watched as a possible bellwether for hundreds more cases related to that day which will come to trial in the months ahead. Jurors took under four hours to unanimously convict Reffitt. According to investigators, Reffitt was among the mob of Donald Trump supporters that stormed the Capitol on 6 January as lawmakers met to confirm Joe Biden's presidential win. Reffitt - an oil-field worker and alleged member of the Three Percenters far-right militia - drove from Texas to Washington DC to participate in the riot, and led fellow members of the Three Percenters up the Capitol's staircase to the building. In court, prosecutors used Reffitt's own words against him, telling jurors that he \"lit the match\" during the riot. Reffitt faces up to 60 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for 8 June. Reffitt's prosecution was aided by multiple videos taken on and after 6 January, in which he discussed planning and later bragged about his participation in the riot. The videos included a 30-minute clip recorded with a helmet camera among the crowd outside the Capitol, and a self-recorded Zoom call in which he bragged about the day's events. Among those who testified against him was his 19-year-old son Jackson, who said his father threatened him to keep quiet. \"He said 'if you turn me in, you're a traitor,\" the younger Reffitt testified about his father. \"And traitors get shot\". Another witness, Rocky Hardie, testified that he travelled to Washington in a car with Reffitt that contained weapons and ammunition. He added that Reffitt carried a pistol and zip ties during the riot. During the trial, Reffitt's defence attorney, William L Welch, called no witnesses and presented no evidence, but said that Reffitt had not assaulted police officers during the riot and characterised Reffitt as being prone to exaggerating. A verdict heard around the worldIt was the trial of one man, but it has far-reaching and significant implications: the guilty verdict, delivered quickly and on all counts, serves as a guide to how other 6 January trials may go. With their verdict, members of the jury in Reffitt's trial showed that they believe the Capitol siege was an assault on democracy. They also made it clear that they thought that Reffitt's claim, that he was just a big talker and meant no harm, was beside the point. The guilty verdict means that others who have been accused of crimes related to the 6 January riot - and there are hundreds of these individuals - will be more likely to plea bargain, rather than risk facing a jury. To date, more than 750 people have been arrested for their role in the 6 January riot, including members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. While most have been charged with misdemeanours, about 40 have received prison sentences. The leader of the far-right Proud Boys group has been charged with conspiracy in connection with the Capitol riot.

The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN. Tiger Woods had already won the minute he walked onto that fairway at the 86th Masters golf tournament on Thursday and, for me, he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t need a sixth green jacket prize to prove it. It was just over a year ago when the world was stunned by the news that Woods had been in a horrible car accident in Los Angeles. Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 right leg nearly had to be amputated but was saved by emergency surgery. Afterward, many wondered whether Woods ever walk again, let alone play golf. This year, 2022, is the Year of the Tiger \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a year that signifies courage, bravery and resilience. And just perhaps, Woods had a feeling his fate would change this year, as he tweeted: \u201a\u00c4\u00faHappy Year of the Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 back in January. No one but Tiger could have imagined that just 14 months after his accident, the Hall of Fame golfer would be out of his wheelchair and competing in golf\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most prestigious tournament. Sometimes, winning isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t about trophies. It is about refusing to be defeated by adversity. Refusing to give in to hopelessness. Winning looks like Tiger Woods, battered but far from broken. Doctor: 'On paper' Tiger Woods shouldn't be able to play the Masters Personally, I feel connected to Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s journey back. As a young girl, a car accident left me bedridden and unable to walk for more than a year. Doctors told my mother I might not walk again \u201a\u00c4\u00ec but I was determined to prove them wrong. It was not easy. I leaned on my childlike faith, believing God would make me strong again. And I pushed through rehab \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and the hurtful taunts from neighborhood kids. Unlike Tiger, my dreams were small: learn to walk again, make the track team, become a cheerleader. I accomplished all three. Since then, anyone who has tried to limit my dreams gets the side-eye. Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 miraculous comeback reminds me of the lesson I learned early on: no one has power over me unless I allow it. On Thursday, Woods did not win the first round but he did remarkably well. He finished the opening round at 71, 1 under par. He was four strokes behind the leader, South Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Sungjae Im. Still, as we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve seen so many times, even when Woods is not winning, he elevates the game and everything around it, as evidenced by the huge crowds and intense media buzz in Augusta, Georgia. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s definitely a different feel in tournaments that he tees it up in,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 golfer Patrick Cantlay, told Sky Sports. What Tiger Woods's close call makes clear They call it the \u201a\u00c4\u00faTiger Effect.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 And it has forever changed the way we see the game of golf. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s difficult to describe the impact Woods has had on the sport since his first Masters win in 1997, when he blew past his nearest competitor by a whopping 12 strokes \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a record at the time. Woods was just 21 years old. Since then, Woods has collected 82 PGA Tour wins, including 15 majors. His last big win came at his most recent major, the 2019 Masters, finishing 13 under par \u201a\u00c4\u00ec just after his fourth back surgery and fifth knee surgery. On top of all the wins, Woods became a cultural icon \u201a\u00c4\u00ec one of Madison Avenue\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hottest pitchmen \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and in the process, transformed his sport. Golf was no longer your father\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s or grandfather\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s game. Gone were the days of watching aging, mostly White men wearing \u201a\u00c4\u00fadad\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shorts, putting balls over their ever-expanding bellies. Fiji\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Vijay Singh, who won the Masters in 2000, was the one of the only nonwhite golfers on the pro tour back then. Tiger made golf cool for younger generations. And all around the world, young and not-so-young Tiger-wannabes started sprouting up, especially among Black and brown players. Everyone, men and women, and children dreamed of playing like Tiger. Can Tiger Woods win the Masters? Hear what CNN reporter thinks It should be noted that history was made on Thursday, for the first time in 86 years at the Masters, we saw three Black golfers in tournament \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Harold Varner III, Cameron Champ and Woods. Both Varner and Champ grew up idolizing Tiger. Tony Finau, who is of Tongan and Somoan descent, also played. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI dreamed since I was a kid of competing against Tiger, playing against him at the Masters \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what my dreams were made of as a kid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Finau told golf.com about the first time he played with Woods, back in 2019 at the Masters. Finau said he picked up his first golf clubs in 1997 after watching Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s historic win in Augusta. In golf, there is Before Tiger and After Tiger. Before Tiger, most sports fans and sports reporters argued over whether golf was even a real sport. Most agreed, it was not. But then along came Woods, bringing his game of power and distance, smashing golf balls, talking about training regimens and weight lifting workouts. Woods dominated his competitors so completely that suddenly golf courses were being redesigned or as some put it, \u201a\u00c4\u00faTiger proofed.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Tiger Woods: Five-time Masters winner shoots one-under 71 in first round after return from injury Most golf courses were lengthened by thousands of feet to try to level the playing field \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Woods and his power game had made old course designs too easy. Golf became a game built for strong, young players in top condition. And any pro golfer who couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t keep up with the Tiger proofing, quickly fell out of contention. Woods turned golf into a spectator sport, and now, when he plays, television ratings spike. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s why media outlets began jockeying for rights to broadcast golf majors and advertisers clamored for buy-in. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also changed the game in other ways. Back in 1997, Woods won the Masters and took home $486,000 from the total shared prize fund of $2.7 million. Just before the pandemic hit in 2019, Wood\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Master\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s win topped $2 million, out of a total record-breaking prize fund of $11.5 million. (This year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s prize money is expected to be the same as 2019). Woods has made the men around him millionaires. Before his rise, there were fewer than 10 golfers who earned more than a million dollars. But by 2018, more than 100 players were topping the million-dollar mark. By 2009, Woods had become the first-ever billion-dollar athlete, topping his good friend Michael Jordan. A look back at Tiger Woods' triumph, tragedy and trauma Nike and other brands have made a fortune designing updated golf clubs and other merchandise for the game, including more fashionable golf wear featuring body hugging, Tiger-red colored shirts and pleated black pants for golfers. (Nike even had a rule no other golfer could wear Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s colors on game day.) No matter how you feel about Woods, the Tiger Effect is real. But not everyone has relished Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rise. Beneath all the accolades and big money, there have always been grumblings, mostly from old-school golfers and fans who resented all the changes and fanfare. Many felt the felt the power game pushed out skilled golfers with less strength. In addition, Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 prominence put the spotlight on a sport that was found lacking \u201a\u00c4\u00ec especially when it came to diversity and the systemic racism and sexism in the game at every level. Thankfully, The Tiger Effect has helped to knock down many of those barriers. But there is still much room for improvement. Watching Woods now, it is bittersweet for fans like me to acknowledge that some of his greatest contributions to the game \u201a\u00c4\u00ec power and athleticism \u201a\u00c4\u00ec now make it nearly impossible for him to dominate as once did. Sign up for CNN Opinion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Because of Tiger, today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s game is about power and distance. It rewards younger, stronger, athletes in top condition. And at 46 years old \u201a\u00c4\u00ecyoung by any measure except in professional sports \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it is unreasonable to expect Woods to intimidate and dominate. His legacy has brought other formidable power players into the game, like 23-year-old Joaquin Niemann from Chile. And now it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Niemann and younger players like him who are smashing balls and winning championships. One day, hopefully no time soon, Tiger will walk away, leaving the game of golf far better than it was when he found it. And until then, golf will continue to ride the Tiger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wave. In the end, Tiger Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 legacy will be bigger than green jackets and golf trophies.

Dressed in his green military T-shirt, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ended his live-streamed speech to Congress on Wednesday with a direct appeal to President Joe Biden: \u201a\u00c4\u00faToday it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not enough to be the leader of the nation \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 It was not a throwaway line \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it was a deliberate plea that Biden should take seriously. A ceasefire or peace deal in the coming weeks could potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives and untold injuries and suffering. It would reduce the dangerous risk of further escalation and the potential of open conflict between NATO and Russia. And it might be the best option to preserve Ukrainian sovereignty and independence. Russia and Ukraine have been talking, but negotiations, which are still in the early stages, would benefit from a leader like Biden facilitating the process. Having worked as the director for European affairs at the National Security Council in the Clinton White House, I saw firsthand how essential presidential leadership can be in the cause of peace. We saw this in Bosnia when early UN peace negotiations efforts failed but US-led negotiations succeeded in 1995 with the Dayton Accords. The one leader who can bring Americans together US envoy Richard Holbrooke\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s success in brokering the deal was only possible because of President Bill Clinton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s personal and direct backing. We saw this again in Northern Ireland in 1998 when Clinton and US mediator George Mitchell helped broker the Good Friday Agreement ending decades of civil war. Sometimes more direct presidential involvement is essential, as it was when Jimmy Carter brokered the Camp David Accords that brought peace to Israel and Egypt or when President Teddy Roosevelt played a key role in mediating the Treaty of Portsmouth, which ended the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. Presidential leadership is essential for three reasons. First, negotiations are extraordinarily difficult because the cause of peace itself often conflicts with deeply felt principles of identity or justice. How do you convince the leader of one country to sit down and negotiate with another who has laid waste to the land and lives of his or her people? These challenges require incredibly strong third-party leadership to focus on the shared goals of peace and stability moving forward. Biden must tread carefully amid mounting criticism on Ukraine Second, the United States brings tremendous leverage and power to the negotiating table across the political, economic and military spectrum. American leadership is often at the vanguard of international support and can bring the collective power and influence of much of the world on board. Third, the American study and practice of peace negotiations give it credibility and expertise, having previously led warring parties to peace \u201a\u00c4\u00ec even when one was hostile to the United States. As Egypt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s President Anwar Sadat once said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Russians can give you arms but only the United States can give you a solution.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sadat cited American leadership, even though he knew America was the close ally of his enemy Israel. Of course, Russia, as America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s historic enemy, is a different beast, and the dynamics surrounding the war in Ukraine make peace talks particularly difficult. Vladimir Putin, who shows no signs of cowing to the West, has suggested a willingness to use nuclear weapons, and any escalation involving the NATO countries could potentially kick off a world war. Can the US be a legitimate peacemaker in Putin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s eyes? Yes, given the reasons above, although Biden would have to walk a tightrope given that Putin will likely interact with the US as a negotiating counterpart rather than as a third-party mediator. But the US can still actively engage with both sides to find peace. China may be able to play a useful role at the negotiating table by serving as a constructive counterbalance to perceptions of US bias. In recent days, China has subtly distanced itself from Russia, and Xi Jinping told Biden the events in Ukraine were in no one\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interest during their two-hour call Friday. But China has not openly condemned Russia, and it remains unclear just what role, if any, Xi is willing to play in brokering peace. In any case, Biden should push for a peace deal, especially now that the Russian invasion has largely stalled. Nobody signs a peace deal when they think they will be better off continuing to fight. World leaders make the difficult decision to lay down arms when their interests are better served by compromise. Those conditions are in place right now. Putin has backed himself into a corner, and he needs a way out of the trap he has set for himself. His military campaign is going far worse than anticipated, both on the ground and in terms of global condemnation. The only way to guarantee nuclear weapons are never used Putin significantly underestimated the Ukrainians\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 will to fight, while the US and its allies have announced punishing sanctions on Russia. With the Russian offensive suffering major losses, Putin has no clear military option but to resort to bombarding Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s cities, terrorizing its people and turning the country into an unlivable hell. This may serve Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s short-term strategic objectives, but would incur a far higher political and economic cost in the long run for both Putin and his entire country. On the Ukrainian side, high morale and heroic resistance may enable Ukraine to resist Russian occupation, but it will not be enough to end the war any time soon. Instead, they will continue to suffer as Putin uses more and more inhumane tactics to inflict punishment. For Ukrainians, a decision to fight to the end may be akin to a decision to watch the destruction of their nation in a resolute attempt to save it. If Ukraine wants to avoid the devastation of its cities and alleviate widespread suffering, it will have to give Putin at least some face-saving off-ramp if it wants even a chance of striking peace. Zelensky has already acknowledged it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unlikely Ukraine will join NATO anytime soon \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a move Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called a \u201a\u00c4\u00fareflection of reality.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 There are already ongoing talks of establishing a peace plan that could give both sides a way to declare victory. But peace deals don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always lead to an immediate resolution \u201a\u00c4\u00ec oftentimes, they simply establish a process for continuing to work through contentious issues. Sign up for CNN Opinion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Biden should be thinking about what potential agreements can be struck in the near-term, and what must be punted down the road for more extended talks. His road map to peace should involve three steps: 1) engage Ukraine and Russia separately to help identify interests and establish an agreed upon process; 2) identify interim steps to build confidence and momentum such as a ceasefire, pullback of forces or cooperative humanitarian measures; 3) when the time is right, push more intense negotiations on a peace framework that will start to bring the negotiators face-to-face for long negotiating sessions. Strong US leadership is essential to the cause of peace. As US presidents have done many times in history, Biden must turn his full attention toward brokering such a deal.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-not-biased"}]}

The ministers' annual meeting - known as the 2+2 Dialogue - was launched in 2018 to deepen co-operation between the two countries. The forum has focused on improving bilateral relations and co-operation in Asia. It is also seen as part of Washington's strategy to help India become a counterweight to China in the region. The two nations have largely been on the same page - at least in their public statements - on most issues of mutual concern. But it's not business as usual this time because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Delhi's press release ahead of the talks included the usual line about strengthening the \"comprehensive global strategic partnership\" between the two countries. But Washington's statement mentioned \"mitigating the destabilising impacts of Russia's war against Ukraine\", suggesting that the US will again nudge India - perhaps not too hard - to take a stronger position on Moscow. India and the US have had differing views over Ukraine since the war began in February. While Delhi has used strong words to comment on the invasion, it hasn't directly criticised Moscow. It has also abstained from all UN votes against Russia. India has also been trying to find ways to circumvent banking sanctions on Moscow to take advantage of discounted oil prices offered by Russian firms. India's stand of non-alignment also stems from its own geopolitical needs. Moscow is Delhi's time-tested ally and also its largest supplier of defence equipment - accounting for more than 50% of its imports. A former Indian diplomat said Delhi's stand has put Washington in a Catch-22 situation. The US wants India to be part of its wider strategy of isolating Russia but at the same time, it can't afford to weaken India against China - both diplomatically and militarily. Experts say this has created confusion in the White House about the best way to deal with India. Washington has not directly criticised India but has issued statements that experts call \"mild warnings\". After Mr Modi refrained from criticising Russia during a recent meeting of the Quad - which also includes Australia, the US and Japan - on Ukraine, Mr Biden said India's stand on the war was \"somewhat shaky\". His top economic adviser Brian Deese later said India had been informed that the consequences of a \"more explicit strategic alignment\" with Moscow would be \"significant and long-term\". But this didn't deter India as it once against abstained from the vote that suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Other US officials, including US Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics Daleep Singh, have appeared to be more understanding of India's stand. While Mr Biden and Mr Modi are likely to focus on bilateral ties, Ukraine still looms large over the meeting. It will also be on the agenda when Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh meet their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin on Monday. Both sides have been clear about their differing stands on Ukraine but there is too much at stake to risk their bilateral relationship. Washington sees India as an ally to challenge China's dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. Both countries also believe that there is massive untapped potential in bilateral trade. They have the ambitious target of taking bilateral trade - which was at $113bn in 2021 - to $500bn in the future. India also needs the US to help diversify its defence portfolio and reduce its reliance on Russian arms. Moscow continues to be India's largest arms supplier even though its share has dropped to 49% from 70%. The US was India's second-largest supplier between 2011 and 2015 after Russia, but fell behind France and Israel in the period between 2016 and 2021. Both Washington and Delhi would want to improve on these statistics. But the elephant in the room will continue to be India's purchase of the S-400 missile defence system from Russia -  a deal which gives India strategic deterrence against both China and Pakistan. The agreement has come under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), which was introduced in 2017 to target Russia, Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. It also prohibits any country from signing defence deals with these nations. The US had sanctioned China for buying the same system in 2018. But so far, it has been evasive about doing the same for India. It had refrained from sanctioning India even after the country started receiving the first deliveries of the S-400 in December last year. But the Ukraine war will now further complicate the situation. Some US officials have said in the past that there was no guarantee that India would get a waiver. Now, in the fast-changing geopolitical scenario, both Washington and Delhi would not want to publicly take stands against each other. But when the defence ministers meet, the S-400 and the issue of sanctions will definitely come up. How the two countries deal with this and their other differences will determine the future course of Washington-Delhi ties.

She made the remarks on Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the panel that will advance or sink her nomination. If successful, she will be considered by the full Senate as a replacement for retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. Recent Supreme Court nominations have drawn partisan rancour in the chamber. If confirmed, Judge Jackson, 51, will be the first black woman justice named to the highest US court. Announcing her nomination last month, US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called her \"one of the nation's brightest legal minds\". It was long past time that a black woman be confirmed to sit on the 233-year-old US Supreme Court, he suggested. The court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. For any Supreme Court justice nomination, the president first chooses his preferred candidate and the Senate then votes to confirm that nominee, which requires a simple majority. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, and Vice-President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, gets the deciding vote in the event of a tie. The Biden administration has indicated it hopes to garner some Republican backing. While civil rights and liberal advocacy groups have queued up to support the nomination, conservatives say they will closely scrutinise Judge Jackson's judicial philosophy, or how she views and interprets the law. Of particular interest will be her time as a public defender and as vice-chair of the US Sentencing Commission. In her opening remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, Judge Jackson spoke of her family and her legal mentors and role models. She clerked for Justice Breyer during the Supreme Court's 1999-2000 term and said the retiring justice exemplified what was needed in the role, the \"highest level of skill and integrity, civility, and grace\". Judge Jackson also briefly spoke of her approach to law, saying: \"I have been a judge for nearly a decade now, and I take that responsibility and my duty to be independent very seriously. \"I decide cases from a neutral posture. I evaluate the facts, and I interpret and apply the law to the facts of the case before me, without fear or favour, consistent with my judicial oath. \" Chuck Grassley, the committee's top Republican, on Monday promised Judge Jackson a respectful process but said his colleagues would be looking into whether she has imposed her own policy preferences from the bench, which \"makes it harder for us to write good laws\", he said. \"I'll be looking to see whether Judge Jackson is committed to the Constitution as originally understood,\" Mr Grassley said. Democrats are expected to lean heavily on the historic nature of Judge Jackson's selection. \"Your presence here to brave this process will give inspiration to millions who see themselves in you,\" said Democratic committee chairman Dick Durbin, calling her a \"living witness\" of what is possible in America. Her backers will also argue that her resume gives her an informed perspective of the US criminal justice system. The Washington DC native will not shift the court's current 6-3 conservative majority if she is confirmed. She currently serves on the influential US Court of Appeals for the DC circuit. Three current Supreme Court justices previously presided on that court. The jurist has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. Mr Biden first promised to nominate a black woman to the top court two years ago while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. Black women make up about 3% of the federal judiciary, according to data from the Federal Judicial Center, the court system's research arm. If confirmed, Judge Jackson would only be the third black American to sit on the US Supreme Court, after justices Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas.

Kayla Mueller, 26, was one of several people who died at the hands of a Syria-based IS terror cell dubbed the Beatles due to their British accents. On Tuesday, her mother Marsha spoke at the federal trial of El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, known as \"Jihadi George\". He has denied charges of hostage-taking and conspiracy to murder. Mr Elsheikh is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US and the only alleged member of the notorious Beatles cell to do so. He has been linked to at least 27 abductions, but has asserted that he was not part of the group. The Sudanese-born Londoner, who was stripped of his British citizenship in 2018, is accused of taking hostages, resulting in the deaths of four Americans - Ms Mueller, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. He is also charged with conspiring in the deaths of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. In opening statements last week, his lawyer argued that he was \"a simple ISIS fighter\" who went to Syria alone to support \"suffering Muslims\". But prosecutors played back past media interviews with Mr Elsheikh that contradict the claim he was not involved in the hostage taking scheme. During one interview, Mr Elsheikh describes asking the jailed Ms Mueller for an email address to reach her family, although he goes on to say he never sent any emails. Inside the Virginia courthouse on Tuesday, Ms Mueller's mother described exchanging several emails with the IS captors, in which she begged for her daughter's life. In their first contact with the so-called Beatles, she and her husband Carl were asked to submit proof of life questions for Ms Mueller to answer. Later emails include a video addressed to then-IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in which Marsha wore a hijab \"to show respect\". The Beatles wrote back demanding either a ransom of five million euros or the release of jihadist Aafia Siddiqui from a US federal prison, within 30 days. Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman sometimes known as \"Lady Al-Qaeda\", is serving 86 years for the attempted murder of US soldiers. When the Muellers replied they were retired and the payoff was \"more than [what] we could earn in several lifetimes\", the captors wrote: \"get back to work\", the court heard. The Obama administration had reassured the Muellers that \"IS won't harm a woman\", Marsha testified. But US officials confirmed in February 2015 that Ms Mueller had been killed in custody. Her body was never recovered. Marsha sat just yards away from the accused, who sat still leaning back in his chair and took no notes during the testimony. As the court broke for lunch, Omar Alkhani, who was Ms Mueller's boyfriend and was attending court with her family, got up from his seat, lent over the bar and pointed towards Mr Elsheikh as he was being escorted out. Mr Alkhani raised his voice in Arabic and said: \"He is in hell you will see him there,\" in an apparent reference to the former commander of the prison where Ms Mueller had been held before she died. Emotions continued to run high into the afternoon, with the father of Mr Sotloff - an American Israeli freelance journalist beheaded in 2014 - struggling to hold back tears on the stand. Arthur Sotloff told the court that the first ransom email he received from the kidnappers described his son as having played a prominent role in \"the US government's battle for the hearts and minds of Muslims\". In the note, the hostage takers called for the release of \"all Muslim people imprisoned directly or indirectly by Americans\" in return for the junior Sotloff's return. Arthur said he had no choice but to keep quiet as the group had demanded media silence. The Sotloffs too sent a video message to their child's captors, playing to their supposed piety by stating that Islam is a merciful religion and the Prophet Muhammad would want them to act differently. Months later, they heard their son's voice for the last time. In an apparently coerced recording, Mr Sotloff asked his family to fight for him and said \"my life lies in the hands of President Obama\". On 3 September 2014, Arthur found out by a news alert that his son had been executed in a publicly released video. He was visibly shaking when he walked off the stand and was comforted by Ms Mueller's father as they left the court. A day earlier, James Foley's mother had testified that she had at first hoped reports her son had been executed were \"some cruel joke\". She told the court: \"It just seemed too horrific.\" Mrs Foley said it only sank in when President Barack Obama confirmed on television that James had been executed.

While the ubiquitous Lin-Manuel Miranda is responsible for every parent's favourite earworm We Don't Talk About Bruno and the film's numerous other catchy songs, it's Franco who is behind the magical score, which seamlessly blends with Miranda's work. She is the first woman to score a Disney animated film, the first Latina to join the music branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the first to receive an Oscar nomination for best original score. If she triumphs at Sunday's ceremony, she will be just the fifth female winner in 87 years. Set in Colombia, Encanto is based around a family with fading magical powers who are battling to save their home. Franco has been thrilled with the film's reception and the soundtrack's chart-storming performance. \"The soundtrack is still sailing up there. The success is exciting, gratifying and so exhilarating. We've been going through this pandemic for so long... and to know that kids are enjoying it, and parents are enjoying watching their kids, that is really the best result we could hope for.\" Franco's extensive back catalogue includes work on Coco, The Lorax and How to Train Your Dragon 2. But it's Encanto and its Oscar buzz - the movie also has nominations for best original song (Miranda's Dos Oruguitas) and best animated feature - that has propelled her into the spotlight. Miranda specifically asked for Franco to get on board, having heard her work on Coco. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

On this one, Lin had written most of the songs before I came on,\" she explains. \"My job is to make sure the score works with the existing songs and can weave in and out. And I was adding the orchestra to the songs. So the end of my score will always lead you to the very beginning of his song, harmonically. And that's why you don't really feel that there's a difference.\" Franco wanted to bring an authentic Colombian sound - but that was a challenge given that she couldn't travel there due to the pandemic. \"I did my best to bring Colombia to me and imagine what it was like, and also I did a lot of research, listening to many, many hours of Colombian music from all genres and periods,\" she says. \"Classical, indigenous, Afro Colombian... I also decided I must use the Colombian instruments.\" They included a Colombian harp, a flute called a gaita, a marimba and some hand drums called tamboras. \"I just thought, this has to be rich. Women's voices are a big part of Colombian music. And so I actually had a 12-piece choir on the track Antonio's Voice. \"Those instruments tell a story about culture from thousands of years ago.\" The score still has that familiar Disney feel, with its crashing crescendos, soaring strings and gentle playfulness. \"I've listened to Disney for so long, so I just I wanted to honour the sound of the classic Disney soundtrack while doing something different at the same time,\" Franco explains.

Her own musical journey began as a child in Texas. \"I was just always that drummer girl, banging on stuff, as my mom would say. \"Nobody actually asked me to practice. I just would take the drums and sit at the piano. And I would just play for hours.\" Later, she studied music and \"really started learning about orchestras\". Franco began composing while at college, later writing for theatre before moving into film and TV. According to the latest annual Celluloid Ceiling report published by Women in TV and Film, just 7% of the top 250 highest-grossing films featured a score written by a woman. That's a small increase on the 5% figure in 2020, while the previous two years both came in at 6%. So it's slow progress. Laura Karpman, who is currently writing The Marvels score, set up the the Alliance for Women Film Composers in 2014. She says: \"I think most sexism is deeply insidious. It creeps up on you. I noticed early on that my male colleagues were having much greater success than I was in traditionally large scale and big budget projects. \"At first I thought it was something that I had done, but I started to realise it was not me but merely the fact that I was not seen as somebody who could handle the larger projects, no matter how many times I clearly proved that I could.\" But she adds: \"Things are opening up. I am so delighted and in fact shocked that the advocacy work that we have all done is working. You see what happens when women are given the opportunities. They get Oscar nominations.\" Rebecca Grierson, managing director at agency SixtyFour Talent, is the composer advocate for Free the Work, a talent initiative that aims to boost opportunities for under-represented groups. She says: \"There is implicit and unconscious bias when hiring people of colour. Couple this with sexism and it's a steep hill to climb. \"Film-makers can help by considering more diverse composer reels and not always hiring the 'safe' option for a composer. Taking risks on new or up-and-coming composers is necessary to level the playing field.\" Fellow composer Dara Taylor also points out that award recognition is important. \"I believe that the common goal is for nominations such as these [Franco's] to become increasingly less historic and more commonplace,\" she says. Franco says she is glad to be paving the way for others while also focusing on creating her best work. \"I feel happy to be in this place, to have other women and people of colour and just people who are different from the default composer to see they can can do it as well. \"I've gotten many, many letters and emails from women all over the world who are so happy this is happening. It's a positive moment. It inspires others to keep creating.\" She notes that it's also important for people of colour to be offered more opportunities to work on all kinds of projects, not just ones related to their heritage. \"It depends on perception about your last name and what you look like - [the assumption] that you can only write certain types of music. \"I worked on Tag, which is a bro comedy, and Little, which is a black story of female power. I feel like now people are starting to remove the filter, but it is a concern that some composers of colour have felt that they don't get called for a certain type of film.\" Franco says she tries to \"just get to work\" and \"not think about the barriers\". But she acknowledges that \"the barriers exist... they're changing but they're still there\". \"I've had people come into my studio and say: 'Oh, did you study music?' The person that I was supposed to collaborate with asking me if I have a music degree! \"I've even had a journalist ask me if I've ever studied music and it's just, you know, jaw drop! There are those instances when you walk in and you're the only woman and people think you don't know the difference between, say, the type of recording resolutions.\" She's philosophical about the state of play. \"Some people have their preconceived ideas... but I try not to focus on that too much because I want to focus on the positive. As artists, we just have to keep going. \"The answer is to keep putting out that body of work and then pretty soon people will see it.\" And on her Oscar potential? \"I feel everything about this film has been a really great experience, anything else that happens... I'm considering it with gratitude.\" Lin-Manuel Miranda talks about Bruno We need to talk about why Bruno won't win an Oscar\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

The US Commerce Department has said the planes are in contravention of US sanctions on Russia. Providing service to these aircraft anywhere in the world - including inside Russia - may lead to heavy fines and potential jail time, it says. The list includes aircraft operated by Russian airlines, including Aeroflot. While most are Boeing aircraft, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovich - the current owner of Chelsea football club - is also included. The Russian was among seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government earlier this month in response to the Ukraine war. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. In a statement, the department said any refuelling, maintenance or repair work of any of the listed aircraft - as well as the provision of spare parts - violates US export controls. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was in response to \"Russia's brutal war of choice against Ukraine\". She added: \"We are publishing this list to put the world on notice - we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.\" The department said violators face \"substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions\". The regulations apply to any aircraft which has more than 25% US-origin content that was re-exported to Russia after new controls came into effect on 24 February, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. \"By preventing these aircraft from receiving any service, for example, including from abroad, international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded,\" the statement added. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said the US government hoped the move highlighted Russia's increasing isolation from the global economy. \"Our actions aren't idle words or dead letters on the page,\" he said. \"They have real teeth and as Putin's vicious war continues, they will continue to bite harder on the Russian and Belarusian economies\". The US, Canada and European allies have already banned Russian aircraft from operating in their airspace, forcing Russian airlines to largely abandon their international routes.

The 15-time major winner stunned the golfing world earlier this week when he announced that he would be making a dramatic return to the sport after suffering serious leg injuries in a car crash in February 2021. After shocking many by making the cut on Friday with some determined play, his injuries and lack of match fitness seemed to catch up with him over the weekend. He carded a six-over par 78 on Saturday, his worst score in a Masters round, and finished with the same score on Sunday to finish on 13-over. While he might be well down on the leaderboard, overall it was a successful four days for the five-time Masters winner who showcased the spirit that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s made him so successful in his first competitive golf action in almost a year and a half. Afterwards, Woods confirmed he will play at the 150th Open Championship at St. Andrews, Scotland in July. Woods said he was still undecided about playing in golf\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s next major, the PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in May. When he was asked if he thinks this week was one of the greatest achievements of his career, Woods said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faFor not winning an event, yes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faTo go from where I was to get to this point, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve had an incredible team that has helped me get to this point and incredible support from \u201a\u00c4\u00ec as I alluded to in the press conference on Tuesday, the amount of texts and FaceTimes and calls I got from players that are close to me throughout this entire time has meant a lot,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Woods explained. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThen to come here on these grounds and have the patrons \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I played in a Covid year, and then I didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t play last year. 2019 was the last time for me that I experienced having the patrons like this, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s exciting. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inspiring. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fun to hear the roars, to hear the hole-in-ones. I think Kitchen made one the other day. To hear that roar down there at the bottom on 16, just to hear that excitement of what this tournament brings out. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have just an amazing day today with now the wind is starting to pick up, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s starting to swirl a little bit. I think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to get tight, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be fun to watch.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wherever Woods went over the Augusta course, the crowds that followed him were rows and rows deep. His featuring at the major that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s won five times was a huge draw for many, with fans everywhere wishing the best for him as he made his highly-anticipated return. And those fans got what they wanted over the first two round, with some glimpses of his class shinning through as he made an unexpected cut. But in tricky weather conditions on Saturday, Woods struggled as it appeared the hilly Augusta National began to take a toll on his body. His recovery after the car crash included surgery to place a rod and pins in his right leg, and excruciating physical rehabilitation. His round was littered with bogeys and birdies, as well as two double-bogeys \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a rare occurrence for Woods at the Masters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec as he slipped down the leaderboard. On Sunday, playing alongside Jon Rahm under the bright Georgia sun, Woods was the center of attention during the early pairings to go out, receiving huge cheers from the patrons as he made his way around the course. Wearing his famous red and black clothing \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the colors he traditionally wears on the final day of majors \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Woods delighted fans with some delicate touches and trademark excellence, including a monster putt on the 14th hole to salvage a bogey. Overall, he carded one birdie, five bogeys and a double bogey during his final round to finish 13-over par \u201a\u00c4\u00ec but walked off the 18th hole to a standing ovation and cheers from spectators. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos While he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t trouble the top of the leaderboard, Woods\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 appearance at the Masters was about more than what happened on the course.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAfter 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians \u201a\u00c4\u00fahostage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration.

Russian troops are not allowing \u201a\u00c4\u00fachildren, women and the elderly\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 out of the city, and have launched an attack \u201a\u00c4\u00faprecisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Joint Forces Operation said. CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response. A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been \u201a\u00c4\u00faisolated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it \u201a\u00c4\u00fain any significant way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days. Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe main issue today remains humanitarian aid,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video. Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are \u201a\u00c4\u00faforced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, adding that Moscow is preventing \u201a\u00c4\u00fahumanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces \u201a\u00c4\u00faviolated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advance in northern Ukraine. That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing \u201a\u00c4\u00faseveral civilians\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fasidelines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe will fight to the end,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s famous wartime speech. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to \u201a\u00c4\u00fastrengthen the sanctions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00faas a terrorist state\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. Zelensky's heroism is coming up against Western red lines \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stoltenberg. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe situation could spiral out of control,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched \u201a\u00c4\u00fanearly 670\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe other half largely from inside Ukraine,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faA little bit more than 70\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 missiles have been fired from Belarus, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faonly a half dozen or so\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol The milestone is a \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrifying\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhere they have connections, family,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

That has left many women looking for options. It was shortly after the birth of her second child, when Dallas-based Aubrey Schlackman had an epiphany. \"We'd been to the grocery store and were driving home. And I passed a big ranch for sale, and I just suddenly had the idea,\" she says. She wanted to open a place that could provide accommodation and support for single mothers facing an unforeseen pregnancy. \"I feel like wide-open spaces give a natural space for healing and contemplation. And I think God uses nature as a way to heal,\" she says. Aubrey and her husband Bryan had been working with Christian ministry programmes taking care of pregnant women. \"A lot of them were first-time moms,\" Bryan says. \"And then we discovered there were lots of situations where a mother with existing children who got unexpectedly pregnant did not have many places to go.\" So the Schlackmans founded a non-profit, Blue Haven Ranch. Although it does not yet exist as the ranch Aubrey envisages, the charity is currently supporting five single mothers who are either pregnant or who have recently given birth, providing cash to rent an apartment, and help towards utility bills. Eventually, the couple hope to purchase 100 acres of Texas farmland to build Blue Haven Ranch from scratch: cottages for 20 single mothers and their children, a community hub where families can cook and eat together, fields for animals and land for vegetable cultivation. The Schlackmans estimate it will cost around $15 million (\u00a311m), and their fundraising efforts are going well, buoyed perhaps by the passing of the Heartbeat Act, also known as SB8 - Senate Bill 8 - last September. That law prohibits abortions from as early as six weeks into pregnancy, after the detection of what anti-abortion campaigners call a foetal heartbeat - a flutter from a group of cells that will regulate the rhythm of a heart when it later forms. This can happen even before a woman knows she's pregnant. One of the most restrictive laws in the country, SB8 gives any citizen the right to sue another individual suspected of \"aiding and abetting\" an abortion. Those individuals could be a doctor, or even an Uber driver taking a woman to an abortion clinic. \"A lot of women are really scared,\" says Qiana Arnold of the Afiya Centre, a reproductive rights NGO in Dallas supporting Black women, about the impact of SB8. \"[Pro-life] protesters are getting more aggressive. And the way the language of the law has been communicated in the media, it's like abortion is illegal in Texas. It isn't - but you've got to move fast,\" she says. SB8 is the latest piece of legislation in the state to further restrict access to termination. Together, changes in the law have led to the shuttering of many abortion services, leaving thousands of women asking: What can they do now? Some are turning to services provided by non-profits like Blue Haven Ranch. The charity is part of a network of Christian, faith-based organisations aimed at discouraging women from seeking abortion by offering alternative services to support them through pregnancy and early motherhood. \"Whatever your religion, if you want to be pro-life, you have to be pro-mom. And you have to do something. I think belief is a call to action - always,\" says Aubrey. At Blue Haven Ranch, mothers are expected to work when they are not on maternity leave, and to take educational courses that will help them secure better-paid employment so they can provide for their children once they leave. Britney* found the project at a critical juncture in her life. She was pregnant, a mother of three who fled an abusive relationship. She was conflicted about having her fourth child, and worried her other children might be taken into care. \"I felt like physically and mentally, I could not provide for all of them safely,\" she says. Britney's sister drove her to one of the few abortion clinics still operating in Texas. \"Very quickly, they were like, 'we can't help you',\" Britney says - she was more than six weeks pregnant. Leaving the clinic crying, she was handed a leaflet by an anti-abortion protester. She called the number on the leaflet and was put in touch with Aubrey. \"It sounded pretty helpful, and talked about not feeling alone. I felt like this was my last option,\" she recalls. Now Britney works two jobs from home, her three children live with her in an apartment funded by Blue Haven Ranch, and she is getting ready to give birth. \"The plan is to keep working, save and get my own home one day. I'm just blessed that I found Aubrey,\" she says. The Schlackmans say that women who join Blue Haven Ranch do not have to be Christian. But they are obliged to attend bible-study sessions. Aubrey does not see this as coercive, and it was not an issue for Britney, either. But the set-up does leave open the question - is it ethical for pregnant women in crisis to be on the receiving end of religious evangelising? Critics point to the dozens of \"crisis pregnancy centres\" that have opened across Texas. Unlike the service the Schlackmans offer, they do not provide accommodation. They provide free pregnancy tests and scans, essentials for newborns, and sometimes support for women to further their education. Usually faith-based, they do not readily advertise their anti-abortion stance. And, they have been accused of giving pregnant women misleading information to discourage abortion. \"A lot of people think those are places they can get access to abortion,\" says Ms Arnold. \"They tell women they can get an ultrasound. Then boom - someone else comes in and they start talking about religion. They say, 'Please don't kill your baby\u2026 We'll give you some pampers'. And it's really traumatic for women because that's not what they went there for,\" she says. But as they proliferate, such programmes will only become increasingly wrapped up in the abortion debate in Texas. The state is supporting faith-based initiatives through its 'Alternatives to Abortion' programme, funded with a budget of $100 million. This channels money to some of the 'crisis pregnancy centres', and other non-profits. Even outside the ideological debate, Ms Arnold says funding from state-backed programmes rarely trickles down to the communities she serves - the poor women of colour who have been most severely affected by the reduced access to abortion. \"To have an unwanted child - you're trying to force people to bring a life that they don't want to,\" she argues. Britney was never completely sure she wanted to terminate her latest pregnancy, and found refuge in Blue Haven Ranch. But many women do know when abortion is right for them - and because of SB8, this has become much harder. A University of Texas study reported around 1,400 Texans a month were travelling out-of-state for a termination after the implementation of SB8. Mariah is also a mother of three, and lives in west Texas. She is a single parent, and works two jobs providing for her children. In October, Mariah's carefully calibrated, busy life threatened to be capsized when she discovered she was pregnant. \"I couldn't stop shaking and crying,\" she says. \"I knew this new law had just passed, and I'm like - how far along am I? Am I going to be able to get an abortion? Where do I start? I have to do this. I have to do it tomorrow\u2026\" Mariah borrowed cash from friends, and drove for over three hours to the nearest clinic in Austin. While she had an ultrasound, Mariah held her breath. Then she breathed a sigh of relief - not yet six weeks pregnant, she was able to access the drugs for a medical abortion. She does not regret it. \"Because I have three kids. I don't mean to sound heartless, but I don't have any emotions towards it. And I do think women should have that right [to abortion].\" Meanwhile, Aubrey and Bryan continue their plans to expand their offer at Blue Haven Ranch. The couple are leaving their comfortable Argyle bungalow with its chicken coop and vegetable patch for a home with more land further north in Dallas. This new property will be a small prototype of their project, so wealthy donors will see they are serious, they say. Already, Blue Haven Ranch is getting noticed. \"We got a surprise donation of $14,000 one Tuesday - it just showed up in the bank account of the non-profit. And so I knew something was coming because God doesn't drop that kind of money for it to just sit there,\" Aubrey says. The following Friday, she got a call from a pregnant mother fleeing an abusive marriage, and was able to offer her support and an apartment. Currently there are six women on Blue Haven's waiting list, but the Schlackmans will not take on a new pregnant mother and her children unless they have money in the bank to provide for them for at least six months. And since SB8 became law, there has been an uptick in interest in Blue Haven Ranch. \"We have increased applications. We probably get an average of one to three applications every couple of weeks,\" says Aubrey. As Bryan puts it: \"The Heartbeat Act got us on the map.\" US permanently allows mail-order abortion pills Top US court lets abortion clinics sue over ban US top court hears Texas abortion law challenges Thousands march for abortion rights across US\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

The US has seen evidence pointing to a clear intent to destroy the Rohingya, with reports of killings, mass rape and arson, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since the military crackdown that began in 2017. More than 6,000 people were killed in the first month of the onslaught. Speaking at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, Mr Blinken called the attacks against Rohingya \"widespread and systematic\". He said said the administration's determination was based on a review by the US state department that included documents gathered by organisations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as independent research by the US. Mr Blinken announced the US would provide $1m (\u00a3758,000) in new funding for the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, which continues to examine atrocities. A case against Myanmar, also called Burma, was opened at the International Court of Justice in 2019. \"The day will come when those responsible for these appalling acts will have to answer for them,\" Mr Blinken said. A civilian government was in charge when the military launched its campaign, but in 2021 the military took power in a coup. Mr Blinken said that since the coup, the military continues to use the same tactics. \"For those who did not realise it before the coup, the brutal violence unleashed by the military since February 2021 has made clear that no one in Burma will be safe from atrocities so long as it is in power,\" he said. The Rohingya, who numbered about one million in Myanmar before the attacks on them, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the country. Rohingya Muslims represent the largest percentage of Muslims in Myanmar, with the majority living in Rakhine state. But the government of Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country, denies the Rohingya citizenship and even excluded them from the 2014 census, refusing to recognise them as a people. When US President Joe Biden took office 14 months ago, Mr Blinken pledged to conduct a fresh review of the issue. Two previous US investigations failed to reach a conclusion. A ruling of genocide does not automatically lead to punitive action by the US, but it is hoped it will put pressure on the Myanmar military. \"It's going to make it harder for them to commit further abuses,\" a senior State Department official told Reuters. There has so far been no comment from the military authorities in Myanmar.

The images posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are labelled with a triumphant caption, declaring that this was the result of \"hits from Javelins on [Russian] military equipment\". The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, can be controlled by a portable unit that doesn't look much different from a video game console - but can send a metre-long projectile straight through the side or top of an armoured tank. The very presence of the American-made weapons \"causes panic\" among Russian troops, the Ukrainian military claims - and the US has sent thousands of them. Javelin missiles are among the items that have been sent to Ukraine through a series of military assistance packages. In total, more than $3bn in military aid has been sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. The latest $800m (\u00a3612.5m) package, announced by President Joe Biden on Thursday, also includes heavy artillery, howitzers and tactical drones to be used on the flat plains in eastern Ukraine. Mr Biden also banned Russian-flagged ships from entering US ports. Other armaments sent so far include drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky. But will these shipments help Ukraine overcome Russia's more numerous - and better equipped - invasion force? The most recent US security aid package for Ukraine includes \"dozens\" of howitzers - a type of artillery that fires shells at targets on high trajectories - as well as 144,000 rounds of ammunition and tactical drones. \"We're in a critical window now of time where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,\" Mr Biden said on Wednesday, adding that the weapons are a reflection of \"Ukraine's needs\" as the war shifts towards the largely flat terrain of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Previous announcements of weapons for Ukraine have included a wide range of military equipment, ranging from body armour, helmets and rifles to radar systems, armoured vehicles and Soviet-designed helicopters that once belonged to Afghanistan. Besides Javelin missiles, the most powerful weapons include Stinger anti-aircraft systems, once famously used to shoot down Soviet planes in Afghanistan. The US has also shipped hundreds of \"Switchblade\" drones, which are designed to be sent crashing into enemy targets before exploding. While US defence officials have been reluctant to provide Ukraine with weapons that its forces weren't already familiar with, this week Pentagon spokesman John Kirby confirmed that a \"small number\" of Ukrainian troops will be trained on how to use the Switchblades, as well as US-supplied artillery systems. \"We're doing the best we can to focus on the kinds of capabilities we know they need and that they want and are using, and...secondary to that, to try to get them systems that they don't need a lot of start-up time for, that they can put in the field almost immediately,\" Mr Kirby said. Additionally, the Pentagon said on Thursday that it is giving Ukraine \"ghost drones\" - similar in capabilities to the Switchblade - that Mr Kirby said were \"rapidly developed by the Air Force in response specifically to Ukrainian requirements\". The range and specific capabilities of the \"ghost drones\", however, are not publicly known. Military experts say that the US-supplied anti-tank weapons have been among the most effective weapons in Ukraine's arsenal since the war began. \"Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we're sending a lot of those in as well,\" Mr Biden said this week of US aid to Ukraine. The invading Russian forces \"are primarily mechanised forces\" - meaning armoured convoys - so \"the best thing you can do is take them [the vehicles] out\", said former US Army Colonel Christopher Mayer. Ukraine has received a variety of anti-tank systems from several countries, which helps increase the \"lethality\" of Ukraine's forces against Russian vehicles, Mr Mayer said. \"If you give them a variety of anti-tank systems, it provides them with multiple opportunities to punch through whatever particular defensive armour protection systems that tank has,\" he said. And while their claims can't be independently verified, Ukrainian officials say they are putting the weapons to good use. As of this week, Ukraine claims to have destroyed more than 800 tanks and 2,000 other Russian vehicles. Anti-tank weapons, however, do nothing to help Ukraine combat Russia's air force, which for eight weeks  has been striking targets across the country. That requires anti-aircraft weapons, about 25,000 of which had been given to Ukraine by the US and its allies by 7 April. Of these, the most well-known is the man-portable, shoulder-fired Stinger system. The system has been seen in conflicts around the world since 1981. It was most famously used in Afghanistan, where US-supplied Stingers helped bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation. It is effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft at up to about 3,800m (12,400ft), making it relatively useless against higher-flying Russian bombers. Maintaining an ability to strike these aircraft has been a high priority for Ukrainian military planners, particularly since some of its own air defence systems have been destroyed during the war. In mid-April, however, nearby Slovakia sent Ukraine the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile, which is designed to strike aircraft at higher altitudes. The shipment was part of a deal with the US, which agreed to deploy US units fielding an American-made anti-aircraft system - Patriot missiles - to Slovakia. The US has so far been reluctant to send Ukraine US-made tanks, arguing that Ukrainian troops aren't familiar with the vehicles. \"The kinds of tanks they know how to use are not the tanks that we have in our armoury,\" Mr Kirby said at the Pentagon on 19 April. \"But other nations have provided some tanks [and] some nations have provided spare parts so that they can get their inoperable tanks operable again.\" Similarly, while the US has so far committed to sending Ukraine 16 Mi-17 helicopters, it has not directly sent aircraft to Ukraine and has described a plan to send Soviet-made Mig-29 jets from other countries - such as Poland - to Ukraine as untenable. US allies, however. have provided spare parts that have allowed its air force to continue to fly limited sorties against a numerically-superior Russian air force. On 20 April, a senior US defence official said that Ukraine has 20 more aircraft available to them now than three weeks ago as a result of allied-supplied spare parts.

Kilmarnock-based Giglets Education was snapped up by private equity-backed ILT Education for a seven-figure sum. Chief executive Craig Johnstone started the business as an enterprise project while he was still at Loudoun Academy in East Ayrshire. The software firm was officially founded four years later in 2011. The company aims to help schools and teachers improve literacy results and raise learning standards in the classroom and at home. More than 120,000 pupils and 40,000 teachers already use its literacy platform. Giglets is currently used by schools in Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, Switzerland, the Middle East and Australia. It works with governments, local authorities, teaching clusters, public and private schools, as well as The Hunter Foundation. Giglets, which turns over about \u00a31m a year, has recently expanded internationally, with a team in Canada serving North America. The company, which now offers more than 1,100 digital titles, aims to grow staff numbers from 12 to 20 over the next two years. Craig Johnstone, who will remain at the company, said: \"This private equity-backed acquisition comes as we look to accelerate our growth across the UK, Ireland and internationally and at a time when the edtech market has never been more buoyant.\" ILT Education chief executive Jakob Skogholm said joining forces with Giglets would further strengthen its mission to \"improve literacy and promote multilingualism across the world\".

He could not say how long the conflict would last, but insisted that Ukraine's defeat was not inevitable. Mr Blinken praised the \"extraordinary resilience\" of the Ukrainian people. \"If it's the intention of Moscow to try somehow to topple the government and install its own puppet regime, 45 million Ukrainians are going to reject that one way or the other,\" he said. The war has already not gone as Russian President Vladimir Putin might have planned, he added. Stiff resistance by Ukrainian forces continued to hamper Russian advances across the country on the ninth day of the invasion. In the south, Russian forces captured areas along the Black Sea coast, and the port city of Mariupol remained surrounded. But the governor of Mykolaiv said Russian troops had been driven out of the city. Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, in the north, also remained under siege. This video can not be played Watch: Sarah Rainsford reports from a metro station in Kharkiv where people have been sheltering from attacks Mr Blinken spoke to BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale after meeting his European Union counterparts in Brussels at the start of a six-day trip to Europe. He said the international community was committed to doing everything it could to help Ukraine and also to put \"excruciating pressure on Russia to end this war of choice that Vladimir Putin started\". Asked if he was convinced Ukraine could win, he said: \"Over time, absolutely.\" \"I can't tell you how long this will go on. I can't tell you how long it will take. But the idea that Russia can subjugate to its will 45 million people who are ardently fighting for their future and their freedom, that does not involve Russia having its thumb on Ukraine, that tells you a lot.\" Mr Blinken also said he was concerned about escalation. \"It's something we care about and are focused on because the only thing worse than a war which is contained to Ukraine is one that escalates even further and goes beyond it.\" He warned that Russian forces were using \"increasingly brutal\" methods against civilians in Ukraine, and that there had been tremendous human suffering as a result. \"We're seeing Russia go after critical infrastructure that's denying Ukrainians water, denying them electricity, denying them heat,\" he said. \"Those methods are, unfortunately, tragically, part of the Russian playbook under President Putin. And I think we're likely to see more of that.\" Asked if the US would seek a change in Moscow's leadership to bring an end to the invasion, he replied: \"We don't seek that, and in any event it's not up to us. The Russian people need to decide their leadership.\" \"What I would say to the Russian people is: How in the world is this war of aggression... advancing your interests, your needs?\" he added.

Mohammed al-Qahtani, 46, was repatriated to Saudi Arabia after a review board determined that he no longer posed a \"significant threat\". The board noted his \"significantly compromised mental health condition\". Qahtani was tortured so badly by US interrogators after his detention in 2001 that he could not be put on trial. The review board said last month that a condition for his transfer should be his participation in Saudi Arabia's rehabilitation centre for jihadists, known as the Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef Centre for Counselling and Care, where he could receive comprehensive mental health care. US authorities have alleged that Qahtani was meant to be on board United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania after being hijacked by four al-Qaeda militants on 9/11. However, he had been prevented from entering the US the previous month. Qahtani was captured four months later on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and brought to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba in February 2002. Investigators there received approval to use \"more aggressive interrogation techniques\" on Qahtani after he resisted conventional methods. Between November 2002 and January 2003, he was subjected to prolonged isolation, sleep deprivation, sexual humiliation and exposure to cold. In 2009, a top official in then-President George W Bush's administration, Susan Crawford, told the Washington Post that Qahtani's treatment \"met the legal definition of torture\" and that she had decided to not refer him for prosecution as a consequence. \"This was not any one particular act; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him, that hurt his health. It was abusive and uncalled for. And coercive,\" she said. A psychiatrist hired by Qahtani's lawyers told a US court that the torture had aggravated a childhood brain injury and schizophrenia that he developed as an adolescent, according to the New York Times. The newspaper also cited court documents as saying that Qahtani had refused psychotropic medication and repeatedly tried to kill himself in recent years. The defence department said 38 detainees remained at Guantanamo following Qahtani's release. Nineteen are eligible for transfer, while 10 others are awaiting trial by military commissions, including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

Fritz Ball and his wife fled to Britain in May 1939 and were found a home with other refugees in Newmarket, Suffolk. They were housed in part of what is now the National Horseracing Museum, where an exhibition will tell their stories. Granddaughter Sandra Ball said they reveal \"the importance of hospitality to those who have suffered\". The memoir, called Interned Three Times, was written in 1946, but it only covers the period 1939-40. It was given to Sandra by a relative about 10 years ago, and she donated a translation to Suffolk Archives. In a film created for the project, she said she was \"deeply, deeply moved\" at the interest in \"the story of Fritz and how it links to to that of other refugees in Newmarket\". The unpublished memoir charted his imprisonment - twice by the Nazis and once in Britain. The Berlin-born lawyer was forced to stop practising law in Germany because of Nazi racial laws and he focused on remastering the cello. As the regime increased its persecution of Jews, Fritz and his wife Eva sent their 15-year-old son to the United States in 1938. Their two younger sons arrived in the UK on the Kindertransport in March 1939, while their parents arrived shortly afterwards, carrying two suitcases and two cellos, when Fritz was aged 46. Within days, they had moved to Newmarket, to share a house with 25 other Jewish refugees, ranging from a retired judge to a three-year-old child. Their two boys, aged 10 and 12, had been homed in the south of England, some 150 miles (240km) from their parents. The Newmarket refugees held concerts which were reviewed by local newspapers - until security concerns resulted in internment for Fritz and all the Newmarket refugees who were also German nationals, and therefore deemed to pose a potential security risk as \"enemy aliens\". Mr Ball wrote in his memoir: \"To be interned twice because one is viewed to be a Jew and not a German, and then to come here and to be interned because you are a German is too much for us. \"All the love and gratitude we felt for England has disappeared in one day.\" His memoir had not named the \"wealthy Englishman\" who provided them with their first English home. Joint research by the National Horseracing Museum and Suffolk Archives revealed they were living in the Palace House Stables owned by racehorse owner Anthony Rothschild. His internment, mostly on the Isle of Man, lasted from May to September 1940, and he had become friends with other musician refugees and they gave concerts to fellow inmates, until Fritz was deemed not to be a threat and was released. Research revealed Fritz and Eva moved to Cambridge in 1942 and they were joined there by their two younger sons, but little else was known about their time there. After the war, the couple emigrated to the US, which is where the whole family was reunited. He died in 1976 in New York City. His granddaughter Sandra was born in the US and now lives in the Netherlands. She said she was pleased that the exhibition, called We Have To Move On, will tell \"the little-known story of refugees in Newmarket\". Mr Ball's memoir ends in reflective mode. \"We were very angry that the English - who had saved us from the Nazis - had interned us,\" he wrote. \"But when I think back to my internment in England, it's with a very different feeling. It was an interesting time. A time I wouldn't want to miss.\" The exhibition runs 10 April-7 August. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Omer Kuzu, 26, testified on Monday that he met El Shafee Elsheikh in Syria on at least five occasions. He said while they did not talk much, Mr Elsheikh had an air of importance. Mr Elsheikh, 33, is accused of kidnapping and conspiracy and has denied all the charges. The Sudanese-born Londoner is alleged to have been part of an IS militant cell dubbed the Beatles by hostages because of their British accents. He is the highest profile IS fighter to face trial in the US. The cell is said to have tortured and beheaded hostages in Syria, including several Western journalists and aid workers. Mr Kuzu, who spent four-and-a-half years as an IS member, testified at Mr Elsheikh's trial in Virginia as part of a plea deal with the US government. He said he had left his home in Dallas, Texas, at age 18 in October 2014 and was smuggled into Syria alone through the Turkish border. He told the court he worked at the telecommunications office in the city of Raqqa, then \"the capital of IS\", and did \"typical IT work\" to support the group's battlefield operations. Mr Kuzu was captured by Syrian forces in 2019 and handed over to the FBI. He pleaded guilty in Texas in September 2020 on a charge of conspiring to provide material support to IS. Taking the stand on Monday in a teal prison jumpsuit, he leaned forward into his microphone and spoke clearly, often saying \"yes sir\" in response to questions. Mr Kuzu said that while other guards wore traditional Afghan clothes, Mr Elsheikh wore a green military uniform and always carried a Glock pistol. Having a Glock was uncommon among the fighters, he said, calling it \"a symbol of Isis aristocracy\". He added that Mr Elsheikh was \"quiet, reserved, almost secretive\", which he believed indicated he didn't want to be a target of foreign intelligence agencies. Asked to identify Mr Elsheikh in the courtroom, he pointed at the defendant and described his clothing. Mr Elsheikh, who has sat through much of the trial in a disposable black mask, lowered his mask to be identified. Identification is a key part of the trial. The defence argues that Mr Elsheikh was a \"simple Isis fighter\" not one of the so-called Beatles, and therefore should not be held responsible for what that militant cell did. Under cross-examination, Mr Kuzu admitted that Mr Elsheikh had never explicitly told him about himself or what he did for IS. But he said \"his work was right in front of my eyes\". The Beatles have been described by witnesses as a cohesive unit. When Mr Kuzu met Mr Elsheikh and another alleged Beatle on one occasion, they appeared to be \"some sort of a duo or tag team\" to him. Former French IS hostage Didier Francois echoed similar sentiments when he took the stand on Monday. He told the court \"the atmosphere changed radically\" whenever the Beatles showed up. \"They were always together and always sadistic,\" the veteran war correspondent said, explaining they engaged in both physical and emotional abuse. \"Manicure or pedicure?\" they would ask, he claimed, before beating his hands and feet. Mr Francois was held alongside three other French journalists for 10 months before the men were all released together in April 2014. He described interacting with several other hostages during his captivity, including Americans James Foley and Peter Kassig. Both men converted to Islam while in captivity. Choking up, Mr Francois recalled the former asking him to tell his Catholic mother he had only done so because \"he loved his God and wanted to be able to worship him\". The government is expected to wrap its case against Mr Elsheikh on Tuesday. It remains unclear whether Mr Elsheikh intends to take the stand when the defence gets its turn.

We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 630 mass shootings across the US so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last three years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That's nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides, according to the CDC. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. More recent data out of the US suggests that gun ownership grew significantly over the last few years. A study, published by the Annals of Internal Medicine in February, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. This, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws - although this fell last year - according to polling by Gallup. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be \"made less strict\". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. \"Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,\" another Gallup study noted, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on \"watch\" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a \"permitless carry bill\" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in April last year Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move \"a monumental moment for the Second Amendment\". He counts US shootings.

A US jury found Roger Ng guilty on all charges in the trial, which concerned the looting of billions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund. He is the only Goldman Sachs banker to face a jury over the scandal, which rocked Malaysian politics and forced the bank to pay billions in fines. He had pleaded not guilty. Mr Ng's lawyer said he was a \"fall guy \"and attacked the credibility of the government's star witness, Tim Leissner, who was Mr Ng's boss at Goldman Sachs and pleaded guilty to his role in the scandal in 2018. But after a nearly two-month trial and several days of deliberation, the jury in New York convicted Mr Ng of conspiring to launder money and violating an anti-corruption law. US prosecutors said the decision was \"a victory for not only the rule of law, but also for the people of Malaysia\". \"The defendant and his cronies saw 1MDB not as an entity to do good for the people of Malaysia, but as a piggy bank to enrich themselves with piles of money siphoned from the fund,\" said US Attorney Breon Peace. \"With today's verdict, a powerful message has been delivered to those who commit financial crimes motivated by greed. You will be caught, prosecuted and convicted, like Ng, and face a long prison sentence.\" The charges stemmed from bond deals that Goldman helped arrange in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5bn (\u00a35bn) for the 1MDB fund, which was founded to finance public development projects. Authorities say more than $4bn was stolen and spent on art, diamonds and property - even helping to finance Hollywood's Wolf of Wall Street film. Prosecutors said Goldman Sachs bankers helped to arrange laundering of some of the money, some of which was paid as bribes to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to help win business for the bank. Prosecutors said 49-year-old Mr Ng was central to the scheme, introducing Mr Leissner to Chinese-Malaysian financier Jho Low, the alleged mastermind and a confidant of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Jho Low was indicted alongside Ng in 2018 but remains at large. They told the court that Mr Ng, who worked for Goldman from 2005 to May 2014, received $35m in kickbacks for his role. Mr Ng's team had claimed the payment was part of a legitimate business deal involving his wife. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, also gave the court accounts of Mr Leissner's deceit, calling him a \"double bigamist\" for twice being married to two women at the same time. He previously admitted forging divorce papers to marry an analyst at the bank while still married to his first wife. Mr Ng, who could be sentenced to decades in prison, may appeal, Mr Agnifilo said. In 2020, Goldman reached a $3.9bn settlement with the Malaysian government for its role in the multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme. It also paid nearly $3bn to authorities in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB. The same year, Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak was sentenced to 12 years in jail after he was found guilty of abusing his power, laundering money and breaching the public's trust. He remains free pending an appeal in Malaysian court.

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson would become the first black woman on the nation's highest judicial body. The nine-member court is currently split between six Republican-appointed justices and three picked by Democrats. Judge Jackson would replace Stephen Breyer, another liberal justice. The Senate judiciary committee, which like the full chamber is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, voted 11-11 on Monday on whether to back her nomination. A final vote before the 100-member Senate is expected by Friday. On Monday evening two Republican senators, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, declared support for Judge Jackson. With one other Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, having already said she will vote for the nominee, Judge Jackson's confirmation is assured. This video can not be played Ketanji Brown Jackson delivers opening statement Democrats point out Judge Jackson would become the first former public defender on the court, and cite her experience in nine years on the federal bench. But many Republicans found fault with her decision during 30 hours of confirmation hearings not to comment on whether seats should be added to the Supreme Court, and her remark that she could not define the term \"woman\". They also accused her of leniency in child pornography cases. If confirmed, Judge Jackson, 51, would be the first black woman justice named to the Supreme Court in its 233-year history. She would also be just the third black American to ever sit on the country's top court, following justices Thurgood Marshall and current Justice Clarence Thomas. The jurist, a Washington DC native, currently sits on the influential US Court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. For any Supreme Court justice nomination, the president chooses his preferred candidate who then faces a vote before the Senate Judiciary Committee before final approval by the Senate. The court plays a crucial role in US life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government. For the first time since 1991, the judiciary committee has deadlocked on whether to recommend confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. Back then, it was Clarence Thomas - mired in allegations of sexual harassment - who failed to win majority support. This time, the dispute is purely ideological. Even Ketanji Brown Jackson's critics laud her character and the ground-breaking nature of her nomination. Their objection is with her judicial philosophy - and the way she would presumably vote on high-profile issues like abortion, religious freedom and civil rights. While Jackson appears likely to prevail, the manner of her confirmation does not bode well for a process that is becoming increasingly entrenched in partisanship. Only a handful of senators have crossed party lines in recent Supreme Court confirmations - something that was once common. The one occasion since 1991 that a Supreme Court vacancy has come up when the Senate and the presidency were controlled by different parties, the nominee - Merrick Garland, selected by President Obama in 2016 - was not even allowed a committee hearing. If Republicans win control of the Senate this year, it appears likely the door will slam shut on any future Biden Supreme Court nominees.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A married California woman who allegedly claimed to have been abducted and beaten, prompting a massive police search effort, in an effort to spend time with a boyfriend was granted bail Tuesday. Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, California, was ordered held on a $120,000 bond Tuesday and will appear for a preliminary court hearing\u00a0on March 25, the Justice Department said. She is charged with making false statements to a law enforcement officer and mail fraud, which stems from 35 payments totaling $30,000 in victim's assistance funds. Papini vanished on Nov. 2, 2016, supposedly while on a jog. She was found 22 days later in Yolo County with a \"brand\" on her right should and bound, federal prosecutors said. She falsely claimed two Hispanic women had taken her at gunpoint, authorities said. CALIFORNIA KIDNAP CASE: MOM PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO POLICE BY FAMILY, REPORT SAYS Sherri Panini leaving her Redding, California, home a few months later after she claimed she was kidnapped. On Tuesday, a federal judge set her bail at $120,000.\u00a0 (Mega\u00a0) She even provided a description of the alleged abductors to an FBI sketch artist. \"In truth, Papini had been voluntarily staying with a former boyfriend in Costa Mesa and had harmed herself to support her false statements,\" according to a press release last week from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of California. Papini's husband reported her missing after she failed to pick their children up from daycare and he was unable to locate her, prosecutors said. She was found on Nov. 24, 2016, nearly 150 miles from home. She had lost a considerable amount of weight and her hair had been cut shorter, authorities said. She was also branded on her right shoulder, but the exact content of the brand was unclear, according to court documents. She was found had bruises on her face, arm, thigh, ligature marks on her wrists and ankles and burns on parts of her body. Upon her disappearance, Papini's husband went searching for her and found her cellphone and earbuds. When she re-emerged on Thanksgiving Day, investigators tested her underwear for DNA, and it matched an unknown male. When the sample was submitted to a database, investigators located a relative of the DNA donor, which eventually led them to her ex-boyfriend.

(FBI) The former boyfriend admitted to picking up Papini near where she was last seen and that he helped her create some of her injuries and burns, court documents said. During an interview with federal and local investigators, Papini was warned that it was a crime to lie to federal agents upon being presented with evidence that she had not been abducted. Instead of retracting the story, she allegedly doubled down. Fox News has reached out to Papini's attorney for comment. The multi-state search for her and the five-year search for who reportedly kidnaped her diverted resources from other cases, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said. In total, the investigation costs $150,000, by conservative estimates, he said in a Facebook post last week. \"Not only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters, but in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain,\" he wrote. \"All of law enforcement in Shasta county was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling this case.\" Undated photo of Sherri Papini.

Thousands of people heading on their first trip abroad since coronavirus restrictions ended have been met with long queues, delays, and in some cases, cancelled flights. Some airports and airlines have been struggling as passenger numbers gradually return to pre-pandemic levels. And industry leaders have warned the situation isn't going to improve for some time yet. Manchester Airport appears to have been the worst hit after issues developed last weekend, while Heathrow, Gatwick and Birmingham have also been affected by delays and cancellations. Travellers at Manchester Airport described scenes of \"chaos\" after several missed their flights, amid warnings that emergency services staff could be drafted in to help tackle the problems. The disruption led to the airport's managing director Karen Smart announcing that she would stand down. Donna Mayfield queued for three hours at Manchester Airport but still missed her flight to Spain to see her 83-year-old mother for the first time since lockdowns began. She said the situation was \"horrendous\", while another traveller said they saw \"customers and staff in tears\". Former Monarch Airlines boss Tim Jeans, who is now director of Cornwall Airport Newquay, told the BBC's Today programme it appeared Manchester Airport didn't have correct plans in place to recruit and train staff in advance. Passengers at Birmingham Airport also complained of long queues for those both arriving and departing. The airport apologised and said standards had not been met. As Covid led to the government imposing lockdowns and travel restrictions, airport operations across the world shut down with fleets of planes grounded. The furlough scheme helped, but couldn't fully shield the aviation industry from the devastating impact, with thousands of job losses across airlines and airports. British Airways shed more than 10,000 jobs, while EasyJet closed its bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle, with the loss of 670 roles. Amid the job uncertainty some workers opted for career changes. Yet as borders reopened and demand for flights returned, the industry has found it difficult to recruit new staff quickly enough. Reasons for the weakened workforce is due to a \"combination of a very tight labour market, delays in the necessary government security checks for new and returning staff, as well as Covid-related staff absences,\" according to the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents most UK airports ranging from Heathrow to Edinburgh. One Resourcing, a specialist aviation and airport recruitment company, told the BBC that finding enough ground staff, including cleaners and baggage handlers, was proving very challenging. Its boss Kevin O'Reilly said some other jobs were tempting workers away and some European Union nationals had left after Brexit. \"It's always been a tough market to recruit for, but it's become harder this year,\" he said. \"Recruitment at airports doesn't happen overnight, people must go through a thorough security vetting process to get an airside pass,\" he added. Meanwhile, Cornwall Airport Newquay boss Mr Jeans said it takes on average at least 12 weeks to recruit and train new security staff. But staff shortages aren't the only issue airports highlighted as a cause of queues. Covid documents are still required by many countries, which has prolonged check-in times, and rather ironically, when people turn up too early, that only adds to queues. John Strickland, director of transport consultancy JLS Consulting, has said the situation for airlines was going to be \"very difficult\" over the next couple of months. Karen Dee, chief executive of the AOA, said at peak time passengers \"may not have the experience they are used to\". She said airports were working hard to recruit more staff in the run-up to the Easter holidays, and were \"working with the UK government to resolve any delays in the necessary checks before staff can start work\". Britain's biggest airport Heathrow has said peak demand over the summer holidays could reach 85% of pre-pandemic levels and raised concerns about capacity. Elsewhere, Edinburgh Airport has also warned holidaymakers to expect queues and disruption over the summer as it returns to full service. And it's not just UK airports being hit by delays - Dublin Airport has advised travellers to arrive three-and-a-half hours before their flight due to similar issues. A number of well-known airlines, including EasyJet and British Airways have cancelled flights weeks in advance, however, in the run up to Easter, there have been a few services grounded at the last minute. Package holiday operators appear less affected. For example, Jet2 is reporting its schedule is operating as planned. EasyJet has blamed hundreds of its cancellations on Covid-related staff absences, with cabin crew and pilots among those out of action. Meanwhile, BA has axed fewer flights at short notice due to Covid. But it took the decision two weeks ago to thin out its April and May schedules to ease some of the pressure. BA has had other issues too. It has had several IT meltdowns in recent weeks which have caused delays to journeys and its Moscow flights are suspended as a result of the war in Ukraine. The resumption of some long-haul routes has also been delayed because of the Covid situation in other parts of the world. Are you flying over the weekend? Have your flights been cancelled?

But the situation is difficult and there is nowhere to get the data from.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Earlier, the city council said the building was acting as a shelter for an estimated 400 people. The information black hole reflects a similar lack of clarity about how many people survived an attack four days ago on a theater in Mariupol that was also being used as a shelter, possibly for up to 1,300 people. The number of people reported to have survived that bombing \u201a\u00c4\u00ec put at 130 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec has been unchanged for several days. It is indicative of the almost total collapse of basic services and communications in a city that is increasingly bearing the brunt of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fierce assault on the country. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe city continues to be shelled both from the sky and the sea,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Andrushenko wrote on his Telegram channel Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt seems the occupiers are so eager to wipe out Mariupol that they are ready to cover themselves with fire.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Four of the seven established humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol were operational on Sunday, according to Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, and almost 7,300 people were evacuated. Among them, 3,900 people were evacuated by buses and private transport from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine government and city officials rejected a call by the Russian Ministry of Defense for Mariupol authorities to surrender the city to Russian forces by 5 a.m. local time Monday, a move reported by the Russian state media outlet, RIA Novosti. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere can be no discussion of any surrender or of laying down arms,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk in an interview late Sunday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have already informed the Russian side about it. I wrote: \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Instead of wasting your time to write an 8-page letter \u201a\u00c4\u00ec open the corridor,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Vereshchuk said, adding Ukraine has informed the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross and is \u201a\u00c4\u00faawaiting a response from the international community. This is a conscious manipulation and true hostage taking.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Russia was offering to open humanitarian corridors to the city by 10 a.m. Monday and \u201a\u00c4\u00fawants to receive a written response from Kiev to these proposals before 5:00,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 RIA Novosti reported, citing the head of Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s National Center for Defense Management, Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFrom 10 am  to 12 o\u201a\u00c4\u00f4clock - for all armed units of Ukraine and foreign mercenaries is a temporary suspension of fighting along the route agreed with Ukraine. From 12 o\u201a\u00c4\u00f4clock, there will be a simultaneous passage of humanitarian convoys with food, medicine and basic necessities,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Mizintsev said, according to the report. Andrushenko said people trying to flee the city in their cars were being shot at by Russian forces. \u201a\u00c4\u00faEvacuation is difficult \u201a\u00c4\u00ec difficult but moving. The Russians are doing everything to complicate things. Last night, cars trying to drive towards the village of Melekine [6 miles west of the city center] were fired upon.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Other residents looking to flee were having their cars seized from them at a checkpoint just outside Mariupol, he said. Meanwhile, Mariupol City Council said in a statement on Saturday night that residents of the city were being taken to Russian territories against their will by Russian forces. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOver the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents have been taken to Russian territory. The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhny district and from the shelter in the sports club building, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement read. According to Colonel-General Mizintsev almost 60,000 residents of Mariupol \u201a\u00c4\u00fafound themselves in Russia in complete safety,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 RIA Novosti reported. The city council said captured Mariupol residents were taken to camps where Russian forces checked their phones and documents, then redirected some of the residents to remote cities in Russia \u201a\u00c4\u00ec adding that the \u201a\u00c4\u00fafate of the others is unknown.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The statement quoted Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Oleg Nikolenko, Ukraine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, called Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s action\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s in Mariupol on Sunday a \u201a\u00c4\u00fachapter from WWII.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faFirst they came to destroy the cities, bombing hospitals, theaters, schools, and shelters, killing civilians and children.

The suspected gunman was killed by security forces following a manhunt, according to a statement from Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s General Security Service on Friday morning. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAt the end of a chase by the security forces, the terrorist who carried out the attack in Tel Aviv was located and thwarted,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement read. The General Security Service said the suspect was shot and killed by the Shabak security forces following an exchange of fire. The suspect was \u201a\u00c4\u00falocated by the Shabak (General security service) while hiding near a mosque in Jaffa and during an exchange of fire with the Shabak and YAMAM (Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s counter terror National unit) fighters, he was killed on the spot,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the statement  said. It identified the gunman as Raed Hazem, a 28-year-old from the Palestinian city of Jenin in the West Bank, who had \u201a\u00c4\u00fano clear organizational affiliation, no security background and no previous arrests.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The service said Hazem did not have a permit to enter Israel and was an illegal resident. The investigation into the attack continues, according to the General Security Service. The incident happened at a bar on Dizengoff Street, a popular dining area in the center of the city, an Israeli police commander said. The number of wounded was not immediately clear. Speaking on Israeli TV, Tel Aviv police commander Ami Eshed put the number at more than a dozen. Journalist Lauren Izso, on the scene shortly after the attack, estimated hundreds of police were involved in securing the area and searching for the gunman. Speaking on Israeli TV, Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai told residents in the city to stay home. The two people killed were men who were both around 30 years old, a spokesperson for the Magen David Adom emergency services said. Tel Aviv\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Ichilov hospital, where most of the casualties were taken, said doctors were fighting to save the lives of four people who were wounded. The shooting is the latest in a series of violent incidents that have put Israel and the Palestinian territories on edge. In just one week in March, 11 people were killed in three attacks in Israeli towns and cities. It was the deadliest week Israel had seen in years and follows weeks of rising tensions that saw Israelis targeted in stabbing attacks and several Palestinians shot dead by Israeli forces in the West Bank. That spate of attacks included five people killed just east of Tel Aviv, in the ultra-orthodox city of Bnei Brak. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not clear whether Thursday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shooting is connected to the recent violence.

A suspect arrested in connection with last weekend's mass shooting outside bars in Sacramento served less than half his 10-year sentence because of voter-approved changes to state law that lessened the punishment for his felony convictions and provided a chance for earlier release. Smiley Allen Martin was freed in February after serving time for punching a girlfriend, dragging her from her home by her hair and whipping her with a belt, according to court and prison records. Those count as nonviolent offenses under California law, which considers only about two dozen crimes to be violent felonies \u2014 such as murder, rape, arson and kidnapping. Martin, 27, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and possession of a machine gun. He is among the 12 people wounded during Sunday's shooting, which killed six others. This Feb. 6, 2022, booking photo provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shows Smiley Allen Martin, two days before he was released to Sacramento County probation for his sentence on charges of corporal injury and assault likely to cause great bodily injury. Martin was arrested Tuesday, April 5, 2022, in connection with a mass shooting that killed six people in Sacramento, Calif. Martin is the brother of Dandrae Martin, the first suspect taken into custody in the investigation.\u00a0 (California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation via AP) CALIFORNIA DA OPPOSED EARLY RELEASE OF SACRAMENTO MASS SHOOTING SUSPECT: \u2018WE NEED TO STOP THE CHAOS\u2019 Police have said the violence was a shootout between rival gangs in which at least five people fired weapons, including Martin's brother, Dandrae Martin, who also was arrested. No one has yet been charged with homicide in the shooting. Smiley Martin typically would have remained behind bars until at least May after serving a minimum of half his time for his previous arrest in 2017, but prison officials evidently used a very expansive approach to applying lockup time credits to his sentence, said Gregory Totten, chief executive officer of the California District Attorneys Association and a former Ventura County district attorney. \"They\u2019ve been given very broad authority to early release folks and to give them additional credit and all kinds of considerations for purposes of reducing the length of sentence that somebody serves,\" Totten said. Corrections officials did not dispute that Martin was among thousands of inmates who received additional credits that sped up their releases under state law. But the officials said their policy prohibits disclosing what prison time credits Martin received. They cited credits through Proposition 57, the 2016 ballot measure that aimed to give most of the state's felons a chance of earlier release. Credits were also broadly authorized in California to lower the prison population during the pandemic. Proposition 57 credits include good behavior while behind bars, though corrections officials declined to release Martin's disciplinary report. Good conduct credit is supposed to be reserved for inmates who follow all the rules and complete their assigned duties. The state \"has implemented various credit-earning opportunities to incentivize good behavior and program participation for incarcerated individuals, including those created in furtherance of Proposition 57 \u2014 which was overwhelmingly approved by voters,\" state corrections spokesperson Vicky Waters said in a statement. Supporters of the credits, including former Gov. Jerry Brown, who pushed for Proposition 57, have said it's important to give inmates a second chance. The opportunity for earlier release encourages inmates to participate in education and other rehabilitative programs and helps to reduce mass incarceration. \"The most recent reforms in California are seeking to change a culture that has been churning out recidivism problems for generations,\" said Will Matthews, spokesperson for the Californians for Safety and Justice group, which backed the changes. \"The question we need to be asking ourselves is, how are we engaging in behavior change?\" Kay Harris, the sister of shooting victim Sergio Harris, places a decoration by a photo of her slain brother at a memorial in Sacramento, Calif., Thursday, April 7, 2022.

Officials added credits during the coronavirus pandemic, including 12 weeks of credit that applied to most inmates. Martin was denied parole in May 2021 under California's process for nonviolent offenders to get earlier parole, after a letter was sent from the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office. Prosecutors said they objected to his parole based on his lengthy criminal record and asserted that Martin \"clearly has little regard for human life and the law.\" Six months after he turned 18, Martin was caught in January 2013 with an assault rifle and two fully loaded 25-bullet magazines, prosecutors said. Months later, he pushed aside a Walmart clerk to steal computers worth $2,800, they said. In 2016, he was arrested as a parolee at large. And less than six months after that was the assault that sent him back to prison. It's not clear if Martin has an attorney who can comment on his behalf. Martin pleaded no contest and was sent to prison on charges of corporal injury and assault likely to cause great bodily injury in January 2018 under a plea deal in which charges of kidnapping \u2014 considered a violent felony \u2014 and intimidating a witness or victim were dismissed. The sentencing judge awarded Martin 508 days of credits for time he spent in Sacramento County jail before his conviction, based on a California law that allows judges to double the actual time in jail, which in Martin's case was 254 days. Authorities search the area of a mass shooting with multiple deaths in Sacramento, Calif., April 3, 2022. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) Martin also had \"a variety of additional post-sentencing credits,\" which corrections department spokesperson Dana Simas said were awarded for time served while awaiting transfer to state prison from county jail. Before Proposition 57, he would have qualified for 20% \"good time\" credits \u2014 meaning he could reduce his time served by one-fifth \u2014 but corrections officials used their authority under the ballot measure to bump those to 50%. Pending regulations opposed by most of the state's district attorneys would further increase good time credits to two-thirds of a sentence for such repeat offenders. Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, a progressive Democrat who formerly led the state Senate, was among those upset when he learned of Martin's record. \"If people have a history of committing violent acts, and they have not shown a propensity or willingness to change, I don\u2019t think they should be out on the streets,\" he said at an event where officials requested more than $3 billion from the state to expand crime prevention programs. BLM'S $6M MANSION PURCHASE PROMPTS CALL FOR DOJ INVESTIGATION: \u2018DISTURBING INFORMATION\u2019 Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen, who once headed the state parole board, said \"good time\" credits are generally awarded automatically, without inmates having to do anything to earn them. \"It gives them enormous opportunity to free up beds,\" said Nielsen, an opponent of earlier releases. The state has relied on such efforts, particularly its powers under Proposition 57, to keep the prison population below the level required by a panel of federal judges who ruled that inmate crowding had led to unconstitutionally poor conditions.

County probation officials wouldn't provide the terms, saying their records are not public documents. Without discussing Martin's case, Karen Pank, executive director of the Chief Probation Officers of California, said generally someone coming out of prison on Post Release Community Supervision with an extensive and violent criminal history would likely have been treated on a \"high-risk\" caseload. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That would subject him to more intensive supervision, including a requirement that he check in with his probation officer more frequently and in person, although individualized determinations on risks and needs would be made and treatment and services would continue to be offered. Hours before Sunday\u2019s shootout, Martin posted a live Facebook video of himself brandishing a handgun,a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the shooting investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Pank said if there is evidence of a felon in possession of a firearm, that can be grounds for a violation, which may result in time in jail. However, it's unlikely anyone from law enforcement could have acted in time even if they had seen the video. \"The big if is would they have known about it,\" said Totten. But in this case, \"it didn't matter \u2014 it was so close to the time\" of the shooting.

But Sullivan said the district attorney just needs to hold a small group of repeat violent offenders accountable, meaning if an individual is a previously convicted felon, has a criminal record, or is caught with a gun while selling narcotics, prosecutors should follow the mandatory sentencing guidelines laid out by law. \"You can follow a timeline of the rise in homicide and the rise in violent crime and compare that to when the present DA took office, and you can see the relationship very easily. Without a doubt, the communities that are most impacted are communities of color \u2013 somewhere between 85 and 95% of all homicide victims in the city of Philadelphia are citizens of color,\" Sullivan said. \"What concerns me, whether you\u2019re a reformed DA or a conservative DA, if you have an increase of crime within your jurisdiction, you should be always be willing to take a second look at what you\u2019re doing,\" he said of Krasner. \"But he seems very unwilling to acknowledge that some of his policies have not had the intended consequences.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition to the district attorney, Sullivan also attributed the issue of violent crime to a lack of manpower and morale at the police department from the fallout of George Floyd\u2019s death. \"Like most police departments, Philadelphia is having a very hard time recruiting new applicants,\" Sullivan said. \"We\u2019ve seen a mass exodus of officers to early retirement and transferring laterally to other police departments, so the police department is severely understaffed right now, meaning there\u2019s also very little proactive policing going on.\" \"The lack of proactive policing is also driven by a perception that there\u2019s a lack of support for the police and a concern of if they get involved in any type of controversial incident how it\u2019s going to be handled by the administration and the district attorney,\" he said. \"You put all that together you have a recipe for disaster.\" Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

Andy Kahan, the director of victim services and advocacy for Crime Stoppers of Houston, has documented the number of people killed by criminal suspects who were out on multiple felony bonds at the time of the killings.

So let's normalise that - and celebrate it!\" Killing Eve star Sandra Oh is pretty choosy about her roles - but she tells the BBC she jumped at voicing a character for Pixar's latest film Turning Red. It tackles blushing, big emotions and, yes, periods. \"I was just so happy there was a film about it,\" Oh continues. \"Storytelling wise, I don't think we really mention it enough, so to be a part of a film that embraced puberty was important to me.\" She plays Ming, the mother of 13-year-old Mei, a diligent, slightly nerdy Chinese-Canadian schoolgirl. Mei is navigating her life pretty well, at least until she's hit with a rush of hormones. This can be derailing at the best of times, but whenever Mei feels overwhelmed or something makes her feel uncomfortable, she \"poofs\" into a giant red panda. The chaotic consequences are a direct metaphor for the reality young girls can face, as they are hit with some pretty big physical and mental changes. Rosalie Chang plays Mei, whose panda alter-ego is a bit like a more cuddly version of the Incredible Hulk. Chang said the film resonated with her in real life. \"I went through puberty throughout this film,\" she explains - and unlike her character, she says it without a hint of embarrassment. \"I mean, I was 12 when I started it, and I'm now 16. This film is unapologetic about tackling puberty. It's not trying to hide, it's not trying to be wishy washy. It just says it straight up. \"It's a really taboo subject, even though everyone goes through it.\" Chang saw the clumsy, emotional panda as a \"metaphor for change and messiness\". \"It's so similar, yet different from me - she growls a little more, she has bigger outbursts,\" she laughs. Although Pixar has explored a young girl's emotions in Inside Out, along with mother-daughter tensions in Brave, Turning Red is its first foray into puberty. It's not a theme that crops up very often in family films. Director Domee Shi says the idea of including periods and the embarrassment girls can feel was \"there from the very beginning\". The film touches on menstruation very gently, and Mei is particularly embarrassed by her mother's response. \"It didn't feel right if we didn't talk about it,\" says the film-maker, who won 2019's short animation Oscar for Bao, and co-wrote Turning Red with Julia Cho. Producer Lindsey Collins adds they tested out responses to the film during early screenings for Pixar colleagues. \"Just getting the reaction from the crowd of laughter and shock - it was the best response we could get,\" she says. Carolyn Danckaert, founder of the website A Mighty Girl, which includes advice for girls and parents about periods, tells the BBC that many parents \"struggle to initiate conversations with their kids on topics like puberty and periods, which tween girls often find embarrassing\". \"When you watch a movie together, however, you can use the character's experience as an opportunity to broach these subjects with a little emotional distance that can put kids at ease.\" Emma Thompson O'Dowd, health and wellbeing specialist at global children's charity Plan International UK, calls the inclusion of periods in the film \"wonderful\". Their research suggests that \"when girls first start their period, over two-fifths feel anxious, and a third feel embarrassed\". \"Nearly two million UK girls have missed a part day or full day of school because of their period, many out of fear of experiencing leaks,\" she adds. \"All children, but especially girls, need to learn that periods are a healthy and normal part of life. Films like Turning Red help can smash the taboos around periods, and create opportunities for open and honest conversations.\" This film is also notable as the first Pixar movie directed solely by a woman - with an all-female key filmmaking team and an Asian-led cast. Interestingly, Chang didn't notice this; to her it was just film-making which happened to be done by women. \"I didn't even realise it was all-female leadership until the wrap party when I first saw the movie,\" she says, while Oh adds: \"There are a lot of firsts with Turning Red, and I think all those should be celebrated.\" Pixar, which was bought by Disney in 2006, has made films including The Incredibles, Toy Story and Finding Nemo, and has won numerous awards including 18 Oscars. Collins said the female crew felt very supported by Pixar's executives, who did not get cold feet about the film's subject matter. She added that being all-female \"gave us permission to stay bold\". \"When we were talking about cringey, awkward moments in the story, you could have had a bunch of people going 'I don't know about that part...' but instead, you were surrounded by women going 'Oh my gosh, that totally happened to me'.\" Turning Red is also part of a surge in popularity for Asian-led films and TV shows, including Oscar-nominated Drive My Car and Raya and the Last Dragon, along with Oscar-winning Parasite and the hugely popular Squid Game, to name just a few. Shi, who is Chinese-Canadian, talks about the importance of \"being what you can see\". \"There wasn't a lot of representation of myself and my family growing up, and I didn't get to see a lot of myself in media,\" she says. \"I really wanted to just share this Chinese-Canadian girl's experience with the world because it's so specific.\" Oh, who is Asian-Canadian-American, told Elle Canada in 2020 she is \"specifically interested in roles that explore a character's race\". \"This is exactly the project that I was looking for,\" she says about Turning Red, clearly delighted there are now \"more opportunities to tell stories I wasn't able to tell early on in my career\". Dr Martha M Lauzen, the founder and head of San Diego's Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, tells the BBC: \"The time is long overdue for a female-driven film, directed solely by a woman, from Pixar. \"It's great to see the studio betting on the promise of Domee Shi's previous unique and brilliant work, Bao.\" Dr Lauzen adds that in 2020, Asians and Asian-Americans comprised 6% of all female characters in speaking roles in the top-grossing films. This was down from a historic high of 10% in 2018 [when Crazy Rich Asians pushed their representation to a historic high], according to the It's a Man's (Celluloid) World study. \"Due to films like Raya and the Last Dragon and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I expect the percentages of both female and male Asian and Asian-American characters to increase in 2021,\" she adds. Turning Red also focuses on mothers and daughters across the generations in Mei's family. Ming wants her daughter to honour their traditions by working at the family temple, but resists Mei's urges to go out and be a typical teenager. Oh talks about this sometimes tricky relationship, calling Ming \"loving and hypervigilant\", which is a pretty accurate description. \"I don't know one person who doesn't have some sort of complicated relationship with their mother,\" she says. \"We're not shying away from it. It's a loving place, but it's also a complicated time in a in a young person's life.\" Shi adds there were a lot of people on the crew of Asian or immigrant backgrounds, with \"similar stories of feeling that pressure and tension with their moms and parents\". \"It was really important for us to tell this nuanced story,\" she explains. \"Mei genuinely loves her mom and wants to be a good daughter, but she's growing up in a world that's very different from her parents.\" Mei finds the film's boyband 4*Town particularly enticing, and along with hordes of other teenagers, is desperate to go to their concert. \"Unfortunately it doesn't align with what Ming thinks is best or appropriate,\" says Chang, while Collins adds: \"When you're 13, going to your first concert is life or death - it's a big deal.\" Although 4*Town are fictional, their three songs in the film were written by none other than pop star Billie Eilish, and her musician brother Finneas O'Connell, who also jointly wrote the Bond theme for No Time to Die. Collins explains they approached them because \"there's something about being able to speak to a generation\". \"My kids are big music lovers, and in 2016, they were constantly playing Ocean Eyes by Billie Eilish, so clearly it spoke deeply to them,\" she adds. But despite the appeal of 4*Town, it's really the giant red panda which takes centre stage in this film. Given the option to decide on her own spirit animal, what would Oh choose? \"I do love the idea of being able to soar and fly, but not like a teeny bird.... \"I'd be a killer bird,\" she says with a chuckle. That could be another film entirely - perhaps one about the menopause. Turning Red is streaming on Disney+ on 11 March.

Joey and Paula Reed, the parents of former US Marine Trevor Reed, stood for hours in the cold weather in Fort Worth, holding a sign about their son and waiting for Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s motorcade to pass by in the hopes that President would stop to speak with them. The Reed family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attempt to set up a meeting with Biden ahead of the visit was declined, they said. Reed\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family stood near the road waving as Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s motorcade passed by before the President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s speech. Paula Reed, Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s mother, said she saw Biden acknowledge her from his vehicle. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat was the whole purpose of coming out here, to get his attention,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, saying it was \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsolutely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 worth it. A White House official said Biden called the Reeds \u201a\u00c4\u00fato reiterate his commitment to doing everything he can to bring their son home, to staying in close touch with them through his national security team and to finding a time to meet in person.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 After the speech, reporters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including a CNN producer \u201a\u00c4\u00ec at the scene with the Reed family could hear the President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voice on the cell phone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s speaker when he called. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t imagine what you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going through,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden could be heard saying during the call. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want you to think that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not something I constantly think about.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds grew emotional and stepped away from reporters for the remainder of the conversation with the President, but Paula Reed shared with reporters details of the call after it had ended. She said Biden told them he felt terrible he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with them while he was in Texas and promised his scheduler would make an appointment for the family to meet with him in Washington. Biden told them he said a rosary for Trevor on his way to Texas, according to Paula Reed. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe was just very, very apologetic that he couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet with us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. Reed added that Biden also told them he \u201a\u00c4\u00fathinks of Trevor every day and that he feels horrible that he hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to bring Trevor home yet. And he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to stop.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki had told reporters that a meeting could still happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00fa(W)e are working toward setting up a meeting with his family. The President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking forward to doing that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Psaki told reporters en route to Fort Worth aboard Air Force One. Trevor Reed has been detained in Russia since 2019. He was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the \u201a\u00c4\u00falife and health\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of Russian police officers after a night of drinking. He and his family have denied the charges and US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan called the trial \u201a\u00c4\u00fatheater of the absurd.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerned the invasion of Ukraine will worsen his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fate, along with that of Paul Whelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. The Reed family, who met with Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan last December, has said they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been asking for the meeting with the President for months. Shortly after Psaki said a presidential meeting was in the works, Joey Reed told CNN the family has not had any new communication with the White House. Jon Franks, a spokesman for the Reed family, said Psaki\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statements were very welcome. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are grateful they seem to have reconsidered and await details. Just a reminder that the Reeds gratefully acknowledged their meeting with NSA Sullivan when it took place back in December. They look forward to gratefully acknowledging a meeting with their President,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Franks said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe want to talk to the President and say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re the only man in the world who can bring him home and you can do it today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said Tuesday before the White House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. Joey Reed said he heard Monday that the meeting during Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s trip on Tuesday would not happen. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we were told second hand was that there wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI know that every second is planned out for the President every day, but three minutes? Three or four minutes? I think he could spare that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trevor Reed has said in recent weeks that he is coughing up blood, and his family is concerned he has tuberculosis. Joey Reed said he spoke with his son as recently as Monday and asked Trevor if he wanted to pass along a message to Biden. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have anything to say to the President. I think that they have forgotten about me,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have not (forgotten about him). We love our son and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to fight to our dying day to bring him home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Reeds told CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Brianna Keilar on \u201a\u00c4\u00faNew Day\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wednesday that they spoke with Trevor again Wednesday morning. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe called us again this morning. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been sounding horrible, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coughing constantly,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd then we had even worse news this morning, he called and could barely talk. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s had some sort of accident and he believes he might have broken a rib.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joey Reed also said Trevor told them he would be sent to a hospital prison on Friday to be checked and while he believed Trevor has been honest about his health, expressed uncertainty that his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s injury was an accident. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt just seems to be getting worse and worse,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Whelan, a former United States Marine, was sentenced to 16 years in prison on an espionage charge he vehemently denies. Whelan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family has said in recent days that the US should not forget about him and Reed as the US discusses Russian sanctions. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are watching the impact of sanctions, expected retaliation by the Russian Federation government, and making what contingency plans we can to support him,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Paul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s brother, David Whelan wrote in a statement released late last week. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPaul\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wrongful detention has always been about the Russian Federation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government extracting concessions from the US government.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf the Russian Federation demands the concession of sanction removal, let Paul and Trevor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s freedom be part of the price the Russian authorities pay in return,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 David Whelan added in the statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur family will be expressing this view to members of Congress, the State Department, and the White House.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. This week, the White House has turned some of its focus to Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention of American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner has been detained in Russia after customs officials detected cannabis oil in the athlete\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s luggage at an airport near Moscow, according to the Russian Federal Customs Service. According to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the administration is working on the process to get her out of Russia. The White House, so far, has publicly declined to discuss Griner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s detention or their potential efforts to secure her release.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. An Idaho man is revisiting some of the most painful moments of his life in hopes no one else will experience a similar tragedy. Vernon Jensen is reflecting on the true-crime case that forever changed his life for the Investigation Discovery (ID) docuseries \"Evil Lives Here,\" which explores how people across the country have lived alongside sociopathic friends and family members who go on to commit heinous crimes. It features sit-down interviews with loved ones, victims, investigators and others closely connected to the cases. \"It\u2019s been 23 years since everything happened,\" Jensen told Fox News Digital. \"I truthfully didn\u2019t know if I could revisit this or not. But I wanted to share my side of the story. Things have been said over the years \u2013 different things. So I just wanted people to finally understand what happened and how things went down.\" Jensen was a 20-year-old studying to become a respiratory therapist when a registered nurse at the hospital where he worked struck up a friendship with him. At the time, Jensen was separated from his wife. After sharing long shifts with Vicki, a divorced mom to a four-year-old son, Jensen decided to take the seemingly friendly employee on a few casual dates. PRINCE CHARLES REPEATEDLY SOUGHT ADVICE FROM PEDOPHILE JIMMY SAVILE, NETFLIX DOC CLAIMS: \u2018HE WAS DUPED\u2019 Vern Jensen spoke out in the true-crime docuseries \"Evil Lives Here.\" (ID) \"I liked Vicki,\" the 51-year-old recalled. \"She was funny. She seemed extremely friendly. I was attracted to her at the time. When she knew I was separated from my wife, she handed me a note asking if I wanted to meet up for drinks and talk. We hung out. But she became very possessive right off the bat. It was very clear she wanted something much more.\" Jensen admitted that he didn\u2019t consider the relationship to be serious. He was stunned when, after spending a long weekend with friends, Vicki managed to call his home and speak to his mother. She later confessed to calling all the Jensens in the phone book until she reached the right house. Soon after, she declared herself to be Jensen\u2019s girlfriend. Not knowing how to handle the situation, Jensen immersed himself in his work. He landed a full-time position in Twin Falls, nearly two hours away from Boise. He said Vicki announced she would go with him. And once the divorce from his first marriage was finalized in 1991, Vicki announced the pair would get married \u2013 and they did. After the pair said \"I do,\" Jensen claimed Vicki became verbally and physically abusive toward him. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Vernon Jensen recalled how there were red flags early on in his relationship with second wife Vicki Jensen. (ID) \"The one thing that truly made me realize there was something wrong with her was when she brought insulin home to try to kill my first wife, my kids\u2019 mother, because she had raised my child support a couple of years after she found out I\u2019d gotten a different job,\" Jensen claimed. \"She talked about it and would say, \u2018I\u2019m gonna kill that witch.\u2019 I just thought it was talk. No one in their right mind would commit such a heinous act. But then one day, I saw the insulin. I asked, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 She said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna go take care of it.' That\u2019s when I blew up. I grabbed the insulin and the syringes. I drove off and threw them in the Dumpster somewhere.\" \"I tried to convince myself that she was just overreacting,\" he continued. \"I thought I could control this, I could handle this. I told her if she tried this again, I would call the police, and I wasn\u2019t screwing around here. I thought about going to the police anyway, but I said to myself, \u2018What could they really do?\u2019 At that point, she hadn\u2019t committed a crime. She just made threats. \"And when she brought home the stuff to do it, I threw it out. I felt stuck. But I truly believed that I could deal with this. And, to be honest, I was always afraid of retaliation from her. She was pretty vicious when she felt I crossed her. She could be very physically and verbally abusive to me. She would punch me, hit me, throw things at me. But I also was raised not to ever hit a woman. And I refused to cross that line because there was no turning back. And I didn\u2019t want to turn back on my faith in Christ.\" Jensen claimed that it didn\u2019t take long for Vicki\u2019s attacks to worsen behind closed doors. While he didn\u2019t go to the police, he eventually moved out and began working extra shifts to help pay for a divorce attorney. It was during that time he began dating Aleta Diane Ray, who worked as a nurse\u2019s aide. \"I remember how incredibly kind and caring she was to her patients,\" said Jensen. \"She never got short with anyone or impatient, even if someone was being really ugly towards her. She always had a smile on her face. I fell in love with her smile. She had a very soothing voice. She put others before herself. It was such a breath of fresh air. I just felt such a natural connection. And as I got to know her, it felt as though we were kindred spirits. She was just the kindest, sweetest person I\u2019ve ever met. I felt hopeful.\" DEATH OF VIRGINIA TEEN, WHOSE REMAINS WERE ID\u2019D YEARS AFTER KILLER\u2019S CONVICTION, TO BE EXPLORED IN DOC Aleta Diane Ray with her daughter. (ID) As the relationship between Ray and Jensen blossomed, they moved into an apartment together in 1999 with Ray's daughter. It didn\u2019t take long for Vicki to find out. Jensen claimed that when Vicki began stalking the pair, he and Ray had made plans to move out and start anew in a different state. \"We started seeing Vicki follow us around,\" Jensen said as he choked back tears. \"I was going to send Diane somewhere 200 miles away so she could feel safe. I guess I didn\u2019t act fast enough.\" Jensen and Ray\u2019s plans together never came to fruition. On the morning of September 9, 1999, Vicki and two disguised accomplices fooled Ray into letting them into her home after Jensen went to work. It was there when Vicki gave the 33-year-old, with a gun held to her head, a lethal injection of methamphetamine and insulin. According to prosecutors, Vicki ignored Ray\u2019s pleas for mercy and then watched her suffer for nearly an hour. The crime was witnessed by Ray's 3-year-old daughter, who was left alone with her dying mother.

(ID) Vicki had recruited her niece, then 14-year-old Autumn Pauls, and the teen\u2019s ex-boyfriend, 17-year-old Matthew W. Pearson, to help in the killing, according to reports. \"I felt an incredible amount of guilt,\" Jensen tearfully recalled. \"The way I dealt with it was with alcohol. I took a very self-destructive path. I should have known. And we were making plans. I was looking for work anywhere out of state just to get away from the situation. I was angry. I knew Vicki had something to do with it. It sickened me. I felt such rage that I probably could have broken my oath with God. I think I would have strangled her. I\u2019m thankful for my faith because that anger could have destroyed me.\" It took an investigation lasting several months before Vicki was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. \"I just remember watching clips of the interrogation. I felt disgusted,\" said Jensen. \"Vicki came across like she was the smartest person in the room, that she could get away with anything. It even looked like she was flirting with the guy who was trying to put her in handcuffs. Just pure arrogance. But that\u2019s who she was \u2013 evil.\" STATION NIGHTCLUB FIRE: 19 YEARS LATER, JIMMY GAHAN\u2019S FATHER RECALLS RHODE ISLAND TRAGEDY THAT KILLED 100 Vicki Arlene Jensen was sentenced to life in prison. (ID) Vicki, then 39, pleaded guilty to the 1999 slaying of Ray, a case prosecutors and judges have called one of the most horrific murders in Twin Falls County. She was sentenced to life in prison. At the sentencing, the judge called Vicki the evil mastermind of a perverse and horrendous crime. Pauls and Pearson were tried as adults. Vicki and Jensen\u2019s divorce was finalized in 2001. With the help of the documentary, Jensen reconnected with Jade Scotton, Ray\u2019s daughter. Jensen said he considers her family, and they speak frequently. \"I wanted her to know the story,\" he said. \"And it felt wonderful to tell her about her mother and who she really was. Diane was a good person, and she deserved to know that. She will now always have someone in her corner.\" Jensen remarried in 2017. He noted that his church helped him cope with the tragedy over the years. Despite speaking out, Jensen admitted that he likely won\u2019t watch the documentary. The memories are just too painful. \"It\u2019s been 23 years, but it\u2019s still extremely difficult to think about,\" he said. \"I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019ve spoken out because it has allowed me to think of Diane and remember who she was. Those feelings have always been genuine for her. The love will always be there.

She carried out her first virtual engagements on 1 March before Monday's face-to-face meeting. During the audience at Windsor Castle's Oak Room, Mr Trudeau was also pictured laughing as the Queen gestured towards herself. The Queen was not seen with the walking stick which she has been using recently. Asked later at a Downing Street news conference about his meeting with the monarch, Mr Trudeau said: \"She was as insightful and perspicacious as ever, very interested in what is going on, asked me all sorts of questions about Canada. \"We had a really useful - for me anyway - conversation about global events, as we always do.\" As well as this gesture of support for Ukraine at the meeting, the Queen previously made a donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal to help people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. She has two high-profile events scheduled in the coming weeks: the Commonwealth Service on 14 March and the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service on 29 March, both at Westminster Abbey. Last month, she reached her Platinum Jubilee after 70 years on the throne.

In a Thursday news conference, federal investigators said the truck's left tyre - which was a spare - blew out before swerving into the oncoming van. Six university golfers, including one from Portugal and one from Mexico, and their coach died in the crash. Both the young pickup driver and his passenger were also killed. Two students, both from Canada, survived the collision and are in a stable condition but still in hospital. Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt Victor Taylor\u00a0told the Associated Press news agency that it would be illegal for a 13-year-old to be driving in the state. Children are allowed to begin classroom driving lessons at the age of 14 in Texas, and must be 15 before they can start driving with an instructor or licensed adult in the car. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said in Thursday's news conference that it's still unclear how fast the vehicles were moving when they collided head-on on a two-lane highway near the New Mexico border, causing both vehicles to burst into flames. Several of the victims in the van were not wearing seatbelts, the NTSB said, adding that one passenger was ejected from the vehicle. The information is preliminary, officials added, and the investigation into the \"mass casualty event\" is expected to last several more months. The victims from the University of the Southwest - a private university in New Mexico - include golf coach Tyler James, 26; Jackson Zinn, 22; Karisa Raines, 21; Travis Garcia; 19; Laci Stone, 18, as well as Portuguese national Tiago Sousa, 18; and Mexican citizen Mauricio Sanchez, 19. Henrich Siemens, 38. was named as the pickup truck passenger. The name of the boy driving the vehicle is not being released due to his age. The accident occurred in Andrews County in west Texas on Tuesday night, just after 20:00 local time (01:00 GMT). A Ford Transit passenger van was carrying members of the both men's and women's golf teams from a golf tournament, authorities said. The other vehicle involved was a Dodge 2500 pickup truck. The Ford had been travelling northbound on the FM1788 roadway in Texas, while the Dodge pickup was travelling southbound. The two surviving golfers are undergoing medical treatment in Lubbock, Texas. Their families have arrived from Canada to be with them, a university official said on Thursday, adding that one is doing well enough to be able to sit up and eat soup.

A 19-year old Minneapolis man is facing charges for beating a man to death and then posting a video of the incident to social media before sending it to the victim\u2019s family. Emmanuel Davis has been charged with second-degree murder for the violent attack on March 6. He was taken into custody two weeks later after a family member of the victim reached out to the Minneapolis police department alerting them to the violent video she was sent.

The victim later succumbed to his injuries, noted the criminal complaint. Davis was identified after police traced his post of the video to Facebook, the complaint said, and multiple people then identified Davis as the attacker in the video. Davis, according to the complaint, later admitted to hiring his girlfriend, a minor, to lure the victim to an apartment building for the assault.

Nathan Drew Morgan, 29, was shot by an unnamed 74-year old man last Tuesday after being pulled from Lake Keowee. An autopsy report ruled Morgan had died from a single gunshot to the chest aboard the man's pontoon boat. But Oconee County Sheriff's department said prosecutors had determined the shooting took place in self-defence. In a short statement, officials said 10th Circuit Solicitor David Wagner made the decision after meeting with investigators and asked \"for continued prayer for the family of Nathan Drew Morgan\". Lake Keowee is an extremely dangerous man-made reservoir which has seen a number of fatalities over the past 30 years. Officials from the sheriff's department said Morgan and an unnamed woman were in distress when discovered, having fallen off a Jet Ski into the water. Neither was wearing a life-jacket and the Jet Ski was circling. \"The man, who had been rescued, became agitated and began assaulting the couple on the pontoon,\" officers said in an earlier statement. \"Investigators have been told that the man may have wanted to get back to the Jet Ski.\" Sheriff Mike Crenshaw told the Journal of Seneca that Morgan may have been intoxicated. It was also alleged the women with Morgan pushed him back into the water in an attempt to defuse the situation, after which he was once again rescued by the 74-year-old man. However, Morgan was subsequently shot by the man, who claimed he feared \"for his and his wife's life while being assaulted\". The bizarre incident comes just three weeks after a jury in Florida voted to acquit a former police Swat commander who shot and killed a man who had thrown popcorn in his face during an altercation in a cinema. Gun related violence has continued to climb in the US in recent years. In 2020, some 19,384 homicides involved a firearm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

A Texas man was convicted Tuesday of storming the U.S. Capitol with a holstered handgun, interfering with police and of threatening his two teenage children if they reported him to law enforcement after the\u00a0riots of January 2021. A federal jury in Washington, D.C. deliberated for roughly three hours before they found Guy Wesley Reffitt guilty of five counts: obstruction of an official proceeding, being unlawfully present on Capitol grounds while armed with a firearm, transporting firearms during a civil disorder, interfering with law enforcement officers during a civil disorder, and obstruction of justice. Reffitt, 49, of Wylie, Texas, didn\u2019t testify at his trial, which started last Wednesday. He didn't visibly react to the verdict, although his face was partially covered by a mask. NANCY PELOSI JAN. 6 PODIUM GRABBER GETS TWO MONTHS IN PRISON Authorities said Guy Reffitt participated in the deadly storming of the U.S. Capitol. His family said he made threatening remarks to prevent them from talking to authorities, according to court documents.\u00a0 (FBI) Reffitt\u2019s conviction is linked to the Capitol riots of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of over a thousand people stormed the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, with some barging into the building. Reffitt\u2019s was the first trial among hundreds of cases arising from last year\u2019s riot. More than 750 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot. Over 220 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors. and over 110 of them have been sentenced. Approximately 90 others have trial dates. JUDGE REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO DISMISS JAN. 6 LAWSUITS In a press release from immediately after his conviction, the U.S. Department of Justice described how Reffitt \"was specifically targeting Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\" This artist sketch depicts Judge Dabney Friedrich looking out from the bench during jury selection for Guy Wesley Reffitt, joined by his lawyer William Welch, top right, in Federal Court, in Washington, Monday, Feb. 28, 2022. (Dana Verkouteren via AP) \"At one point, Reffitt\u2019s camera recorded him saying, \u2018We\u2019re taking the Capitol before the day is over,\u2019\" the DOJ said. \"By approximately 1:50 p.m., Reffitt was at the front of a pack that charged U.S. Capitol Police officers at the terrace on the west side of the Capitol building. He climbed a banister, led the mob up staircases outside the Capitol building, and kept advancing on the officers holding the police line, even as he was struck repeatedly by the officers\u2019 less than lethal projectiles and O.C. spray.\" During the trial\u2019s closing arguments on Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Risa Berkower told jurors that Reffitt drove to Washington, D.C., intending to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s electoral victory. Reffitt proudly \"lit the fire\" that allowed others in a mob to overwhelm Capitol police officers near the Senate doors, the prosecutor said.

(Dana Verkouteren via AP) The defense lawyer urged jurors to acquit Reffitt of all charges but one: He said they should convict him of a misdemeanor charge that he entered and remained in a restricted area. Jurors saw videos that captured the confrontation between a few Capitol police officers and a mob of people, including Reffitt, who approached them on the west side of the Capitol. Reffitt was armed with a Smith & Wesson pistol in a holster on his waist, carrying zip-tie handcuffs and wearing body armor and a helmet equipped with a video camera when he advanced on police, according to prosecutors. He retreated after an officer pepper sprayed him in the face, but he waved on other rioters who ultimately breached the building, prosecutors said. Before the crowd advanced, Reffitt used a megaphone to shout at police to step aside and to urge the mob to push forward and overtake officers. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nestler said\u00a0Reffitt played a leadership role that day. During last Friday\u2019s testimony, prosecutors zoomed in on a video image of Reffitt at the Capitol. FBI Special Agent Laird Hightower said the image shows \"a silvery metallic linear object\" in a holster protruding from under Reffitt\u2019s jacket as he leaned forward. Shauni Kerkhoff, who was one of the Capitol police officers who tried to repel Reffitt, said she launched pepperballs that didn\u2019t stop him from advancing. She testified that Reffitt appeared to be leading the crowd upstairs toward police. Reffitt\u2019s 19-year-old son, Jackson, testified last Thursday that his father threatened him and his sister, then 16, after he drove home from Washington. Reffitt told his children they would be traitors if they reported him to authorities and said \"traitors get shot,\" Jackson Reffitt recalled. Jackson Reffitt, then 18, said the threat terrified him. His younger sister, Peyton, was listed as a possible government witness but didn\u2019t testify. Reffitt used a cellphone app to secretly record his father boasting about his role in the riot, he said. Jurors heard excerpts of that family conversation. He initially contacted the FBI on Christmas Eve, less than two weeks before the riot, to report concerns about his father\u2019s behavior and increasingly worrisome rhetoric. But the FBI didn\u2019t respond until Jan. 6, after the riot erupted. Supporters of President Donald Trump climb the west wall of the the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington.

Lore-Elisabeth Blumenthal, 35, pleaded guilty last week to two counts of obstructing law enforcement during a civil disorder, each carrying a maximum five-year term, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. She would have faced a seven-year minimum sentence if convicted of arson.

Prosecutors argued that Blumenthal \u2014 identified through news footage and social media posts, her online activity and a distinctive tattoo and T-shirt \u2014 put hundreds of protesters at risk and then fought off and tried to evade agents who came to arrest her. Authorities also reported finding goggles, a backpack and flame-retardant gloves in Blumenthal\u2019s home and suggested that bringing them to the protest suggested an intent to destroy property.

But with last year's viewing figures at an all-time low, organisers are under pressure to make the ceremony relevant again, particularly to younger audiences. There used to be a hundred reasons to sit down and watch the Oscars. In a pre-social media age, it provided a rare opportunity to glimpse the world's biggest film stars gathered in the same place; to see what they were wearing and (for masochists) to hear their speeches. Secondly, it was a place to catch clips of the year's most acclaimed films, long before YouTube made trailers available on demand. And thirdly, there quite frankly wasn't much else to do. The highest-rating Oscars aired at a time when linear television was dominant, and there weren't as many channels to watch. But in an era of TikTok, YouTube and streaming, the biggest showbiz night of the year has been losing viewers and, with them, its power. \"The biggest challenge is getting people to watch,\" ceremony producer Will Packer told Little Gold Men. \"What that means is there's got to be something different about the show this year that connects with people outside of Hollywood. You've got to connect with the casual movie fan.\" It is a delicate balance trying to keep the ratings high while simultaneously preserving everything that makes the Oscars sacred and prestigious. Here are five ways the Academy is hoping to capture audiences this year. Much to the Academy's relief, there are some proper movie stars in the running for the big prizes this year. Will Smith, who has never won an Oscar, is the firm favourite to win best actor for his performance in King Richard - where he plays the determined father of a young Venus and Serena Williams. As early as September 2021, Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson said: \"I don't see anyone beating him. It feels like the timing is right, the movie is right, the subject matter is right, and the kind of performance is right. It's playful but also serious, and we know the Academy likes actors playing a real-life person.\" Rewarding Smith, he noted, would also be making a statement - that after two years of cinemas being closed due to lockdowns, movies, and movie stars, are back. Nicole Kidman, Olivia Colman, Jessica Chastain, Penelope Cruz and Kristen Stewart's nominations make the best actress category similarly starry. However, there less of a consensus about who will triumph here. The frontrunner has changed several times, but Chastain is the current favourite, following her recent recognition from the Screen Actors Guild and the Critics' Choice awards. The Academy has also lined up a plethora of big names to present the awards, including Lady Gaga, Shang-Chi star Simu Liu, The Batman's Zoe Kravitz and Ukraine-born actress Mila Kunis. The Oscars have not had a presenter since 2018, arguably missing an opportunity for jokes, monologues and sketches to go viral and grab headlines - a strategy which has worked well for the Golden Globes. Sadly, getting an A-lister proved challenging, partly due to scheduling conflicts, partly because many big names would presumably run a mile given the potential pitfalls involved (the memory of James Franco and Anne Hathaway's disastrous stint in 2011 still looms large). The Academy has instead settled on Amy Schumer, who was big in 2015, alongside actress Regina Hall and comedian Wanda Sykes - who are both well-respected but not exactly huge international names. However, Schumer has recently indicated she might be taking a leaf out of the Globes' playbook, and using the opportunity to poke fun at the stars in the room (an approach we warmly support). \"I'm going to get myself in some trouble,\" she told Extra earlier this month. \"Wanda, Regina are hilarious, and we're having a blast preparing. \"I mean, I don't know who made the decision to let me personally be a host, but it's not a good one\u2026 because it'll burn all bridges. I'll burn every bridge.\" Perhaps the most interesting new addition this year is the fan favourite prize - an attempt to recognise more mainstream films during the ceremony. Without it, The Academy would have been acutely aware that they had not nominated 2021's biggest box office successes, including Spider-Man: No Way Home and No Time To Die, in the major categories. Meryl Johnson, the Academy's vice president of digital marketing, said the introduction of fan favourite would \"help build an engaged and excited digital audience leading up to this year's ceremony\", and voting was opened to the public for two weeks. However, people could vote up to 20 times a day, which meant the voting process was liable to manipulation by organised and mobilised fan bases. Which is exactly what happened. Although Spider-Man still has a good shot, the Camila Cabello-starring Cinderella musical and the arthouse Johnny Depp film Minamata could bizarrely (and hilariously) end up being recognised at the Oscars instead. We'll have more on the new fan favourite category later this week. Eight of the 23 awards this year will be pre-recorded in an effort to save time during the telecast. While the big awards will still be live, the so-called \"below-the-line\" categories like best editing, sound and production design will have been presented earlier. That means the nominees in the technical categories will be seated a full hour before the main ceremony begins. Their awards will be presented off-air, and highlights will then be edited into the TV broadcast. \"We must prioritise the television audience to increase viewer engagement and keep the show vital, kinetic, and relevant,\" Academy president David Rubin wrote in a letter to members last month. But there has been resistance to the idea from big figures within the industry. \"I feel very strongly that this is perhaps the most collaborative medium in the world,\" West Side Story director Steven Spielberg told Deadline. \"All of us make movies together, we become a family where one craft is just as indispensable as the next. \"I feel that at the Academy Awards there is no above-the-line, there is no below-the-line. All of us are on the same line bringing the best of us to tell the best stories we possibly can.\" In 2019, the Oscars reversed their decision to present awards during the commercials after significant industry backlash. This time they're standing firm, but unlike the commercials idea, the tech winners will at least still feature in the main ceremony. You couldn't hold the Oscars without acknowledging that one of the biggest worldwide chart hits of the past year was from a movie soundtrack. So the Academy is going all in, announcing that the cast of Encanto will perform the smash We Don't Talk About Bruno live for the first time during the ceremony. We'll gloss over the fact that an entirely different track from Encanto is the one actually nominated for best original song because we can't wait to see how complex, overlapping salsa melodies of Bruno might be performed live. In the film, it's performed by more than 10 characters, so it could be a complicated one to stage. The conversation about how to arrest the decline in viewing figures rolls around like clockwork every year. The lower the ratings get, the louder the cries for changes become. Last year's Oscars attracted their worst-ever TV audience, with just 10.4 million viewers tuning in. However, the subdued 2021 ceremony was unusual - taking place during worldwide lockdowns after a year that saw few major film releases - so it's an unreliable benchmark. This year, Covid restrictions have eased and the ceremony is returning to normal, so the Academy is pulling out all the stops in an effort to make sure the viewing figures rebound to pre-pandemic levels  - equalling or bettering 2020's figure of 23.6 million. But some have questioned whether staying relevant to a mass audience is even necessary. \"I don't get why movie people care so much if other people care what awards we give ourselves,\" actor Seth Rogen told Insider. \"I don't care who wins the automobile awards. \"No other industry expects everyone to care about what awards they shower upon themselves. Maybe people just don't care. Maybe they did for a while and they stopped caring. And why should they?\" Some former Oscar winners aren't even bothered about attending. \"I won't be going this year. To be honest, they're actually really boring,\" Don't Look Up star Sir Mark Rylance told the Radio Times this month. \"I don't think awards are a serious marker of what the greatest or most inspiring things are, but it's nice to be celebrated.\" The Oscars take place on Sunday 27 March.

A well-known and respected director on the festival circuit through films such as Happy Hour and Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, his latest movie, Drive My Car, has catapulted him from the arthouse scene straight to the Hollywood hills. As a searing Japanese-language film about an actor/theatre director navigating his way through complicated grief following the sudden death of his wife, there were early suggestions it would be a frontrunner on the Academy Awards' international film shortlist. But as this gentle, absorbing epic slowly began to gain traction, it was ultimately rewarded with not one but four Oscar nominations last month - best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay and (no prizes for guessing) best international film. \"I'm surprised to see my work nominated for Oscars,\" Hamaguchi tells the BBC in his typically understated way, via an interpreter. \"And it's beyond my imagination, but getting interviews like this, I'm starting to realise this is real.\" While the recognition may be unexpected, Hamaguchi is keen to point out that the divide between so-called indie films and Hollywood-backed studio movies isn't always as big as we might think. \"I don't think there's a big gap between the two and even arthouse films are appealing to the masses. A lot of classic films have a higher level of art and I don't think there's a lot of difference between the two,\" he says. It's certainly true that this isn't the first time in recent years that an arthouse film has gained the Academy's attention, with movies such as Moonlight picking up best picture in 2016 and South Korean hit Parasite triumphing in the same category three years later. But Drive My Car is the first Japanese film to be nominated for an Oscar for best picture. It follows the story of Yusuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima) whose wife Oto (Reika Kirishima) dies suddenly. Two years later, he drives his beloved vintage Saab 900 to Hiroshima to direct a production of Chekov's Uncle Vanya. There he forms an unlikely friendship with his young female chauffeur Misaki Watari (Toko Miura) who is employed to drive him back and forth from rehearsals. Kafuku listens to tapes of his late wife reading lines from the play in the car, processing his grief as he gradually opens up to Misaki, who in turn becomes less reticent as the film progresses. At three hours long - including a 40-minute prelude ahead of the opening credits - it's the longest film on this year's shortlist. Some critics have pointed out that a little endurance may be required due to the running time. Writing in The Observer, Wendy Ibe notes \"this is a supremely confident piece of film-making from Ryusuke Hamaguchi, albeit one that, at three hours long and with a rather Chekhov-heavy second half, will certainly require the right mindset\". But the overall consensus is that the film is richly rewarding, with a 98% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the LA Times's Justin Chang calling the film \"a haunting masterpiece\". Its length is in stark contrast to its source material, a sparse short story by renowned Japanese writer Haruki Murakami. So how did Hamaguchi and co-writer Takamasa Oe go about expanding the tale? \"Creating the screenplay was challenging,\" he admits. \"The original story is only about 40 pages long but deep inside there's a huge narrative by the author. And to use a house analogy, we've tried to dig deep and find a house buried deep down - we thought it was a house but it was actually a massive divine palace that we found. \"So it developed and turned out to be huge,\" he explains. \"I read this short story when it was published in a magazine and I liked it. \"I was attracted by the conversations in the car during which the two were getting closer and closer. There was a subtle expression about their relationship, and I have had that sort of experience myself in my own life. I started to feel I could relate to those two people within the novel and so I wanted to make it into a film,\" Hamaguchi says. I mention a recent article by a psychologist who suggested the best place to talk to uncommunicative teenagers was the car as it's an intimate setting but one where you don't have to make eye contact. Hamaguchi agrees. \"The car is a space where you don't have to look at each other, and it's a situation when you can create a relationship that wouldn't be possible outside of the car. And you don't get to be judgemental about the other person within this kind of space. \"You can express your feelings and emotions in an honest way. You can be close to the other person and it can be intimate. And if you don't speak or express yourself, it could actually be awkward,\" he says. While three-hour films are not unheard of - think Avengers: Endgame for starters - it can be off-putting for some cinema-goers or even those streaming from the comfort of their sofa. But Hamaguchi says there was no pressure from the film company, Modern Films, to shorten it. \"It's not that I don't want it to be seen by anyone. On the contrary, I want as many people as possible to see this film. I wanted to make as short a film as possible! But when I created these characters\u2026 and when I was editing the film, I saw it needed this kind of expression. \"It was down to the producers to make the final decision and after editing, they watched the film and decided that this was the best version possible. So in a way they took the risk and I'm really grateful for that.\" The film also features a sizeable ensemble cast, with Hamaguchi deliberately choosing a multilingual cast for the Uncle Vanya play which means the actors cannot understand what each other are saying and have to rely on other cues. \"We needed to encourage different interactions between different actors... it's all about interplay. You need to look and listen.\" The cast includes Park Yoo-Rim, who plays a deaf actress in the film, using Korean sign language. \"I wanted to use sign language because I was invited to a film festival for deaf people and sign language was a common way of communicating between them. I felt I was a bit like a foreign person in there,\" Hamaguchi explains.  \"It's simply another language... that I found very beautiful.\" It's not hard to see the parallels between Chekov's protagonist Ivan - a man who is re-evaluating his life - and Kafuku. Chekhov is terrifying,\" Kafuku says in the script, because \"when you say his lines, it drags out the real you.\" I ask what makes the film resonate with so many film-goers. \"People ask that question often,\" he replies, \"but I can only say I don't know why. Because I'm the one to convey the message. And I'm not the one to receive it.\" He politely throws it back to me: \"Why do you think it is?\" I reply that perhaps it's because the journey of grief is such a universal one. And the grieving process cannot be rushed, which the film poignantly underlines. \"What you just said is about right and in essence, I think it all comes down to the universality of Murakami's narratives. These are people who lost something\u2026 you try to start your life again. And this kind of experience happens to everyone. \"You've got to love, to love others and at one time, you will lose them. And it's absolutely universal. It's a very strong message from Murakami. He depicts the narrative in great detail. And I wanted to do that in the film context and I think I was successful to a certain degree.\" The Power of the Dog leads Oscar nominations Oscars 2022: All the winners and nominees How to watch this year's Oscar-winning films\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}

There is mounting international anger over the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha, a town near the capital Kyiv. \"This guy is brutal,\" Mr Biden said of the Russian leader, adding that he believes Mr Putin \"is a war criminal\". Without evidence, Russia said images of atrocities had been staged by Ukraine. Mr Biden's intervention follows the publication of new satellite photos by the earth observation company Maxar, which show bodies lining Bucha's streets during its occupation by Russian forces. An analysis of the photos by the New York Times showed at least 11 bodies on the streets since 11 March, when Russian forces controlled the city. Russia claims that no civilians suffered under the Russian occupation of Bucha and says footage and photos from the city were staged. But the timing of these satellite images appears to disprove the idea that the bodies only appeared after Russian soldiers left. US officials say they are supporting a team of international prosecutors heading to Bucha to collect evidence. The Ukrainian government has started a war crimes investigation after it said the bodies of 410 civilians had been found in areas around Kyiv. Some were discovered in mass graves while others had their hands tied and had apparently been shot at close range. Officials in Kyiv also accused Russian forces of killing a village head, her husband and her son in the village of Motoyzhyn for aiding Ukrainian troops in the area. \"You may remember I got criticised for calling Putin a war criminal,\" Mr Biden said. \"You saw what happened in Bucha - he is a war criminal... but we have to gather all the detail so this can have a war crimes trial.\" Mr Biden said the Bucha discovery was \"outrageous\" and said that it was important Mr Putin was \"held accountable\" for atrocities committed by his military in Ukraine. He would seek to impose further sanctions on Russia, he added. The US state department said it had credible reports of rape, torture and summary executions carried out by Russian forces as part of what it described as a \"broader, troubling campaign\" by Moscow. At the request of Ukraine, the international prosecutors will support the prosecutor general of Ukraine's war crimes unit. \"There are reports and images of a nightmare litany of atrocities,\" said state department spokesman Ned Price. The Pentagon said it was \"fairly obvious\" that Russia had been behind the atrocities in Bucha, but that more investigation was needed to ascertain which units were responsible. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also accused Russia of war crimes during a televised address on Monday night and suggested Mr Putin's regime would attempt to cover up evidence of other atrocities. \"I'm sure you know about the new old tactics of Russian propagandists who are constantly trying to reject accusations of the Russian military,\" President Zelensky said. \"Now they are doing the same thing. The same lies. They are trying to distort the facts. But, as then, they will not succeed. They will not be able to deceive the whole world.\" France and Germany announced on Monday they are expelling Russian diplomats in response to the discoveries in Bucha. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the expulsion of 40 envoys was in response to the \"unbelievable brutality\" the Kremlin had unleashed in Ukraine. The French government said it would expel \"many\" Russian staff, but didn't specify the exact number. Lithuania said it was expelling the Russian ambassador, citing atrocities it says have been committed by Russian troops in Ukraine. Moscow's ambassador to the UN said Russia would present \"empirical evidence\" to the UN Security Council demonstrating that Western statements on events at Bucha were lies. At a press conference in New York, Vasily Nebenzya accused Ukraine and its \"Western sponsors\" of fabricating evidence and carrying out a false flag attack on its own people. In Bucha, witnesses have described Russian soldiers firing on men fleeing after refusing to allow them to leave through humanitarian corridors. At least 20 dead men were found lying in the street, many of them with extensive wounds. Some had been shot through the temple, as if executed, while others had clearly been run over by tanks. Satellite images taken by Maxar show a 14m (45ft) mass grave in the city near the church of St Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints. Have you been affected by what's happening?

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A small town Georgia community rocked by the triple homicide of a local gun shop owner, his elderly wife and their teenage grandson is still reeling, as authorities still have not publicly identified any suspects Monday in what\u2019s believed to be an armed robbery during which as many as 40 guns were stolen. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the City of Grantville, Georgia, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation is offering a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the triple murder that happened between 5:30 and 6 p.m. Friday at Lock, Stock and Barrel Shooting Range, a federal firearms licensee about 50 miles southwest of Atlanta. The owner, 75-year-old Thomas Richard Hawk Sr., his 75-year-old wife, Evelyn Hawk, and their 17-year-old grandson, Luke Hawk, who was helping his grandparents close up shop while on spring break from high school, were murdered in what authorities said was an armed robbery. The Grantville Police Department said approximately 40 weapons and the shop\u2019s camera DVR were taken from the scene. USPS STOPS DELIVERIES TO CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER REPEATED ATTACKS ON MAIL CARRIERS: REPORT Scott Sweetow, a former Special Agent in Charge of the ATF's Atlanta Division, speculated that the suspect or suspects knew the owner or were at least familiar with the shop, noting that although after-hours burglaries at gun shops are common, robberies are not because thieves usually are careful to make sure everyone is out of the shop first knowing that staff would probably be better armed. \"One of the things that we find historically when looking at guns for burglaries is that people know what they're targeting,\" he told WXIA-TV. \"It would not surprise me at all that once this is solved, and it will be solved, that the people were either familiar with the location because they have been in there multiple times or they had some other sort of inside knowledge about what was going on inside that store.\" \"You would be astounded just how quickly guns that are stolen from burglaries end up on the street and are often used in crimes,\" Sweetow added. As of Sunday evening, Grantville police chief Steve Whitlock told WMAZ that no suspects had been identified and no video evidence had been recovered. Flowers and crime scene tape remained at the scene. \"To think that we have animals like that living in our community blows my mind,\" Mike Menese, a friend of the gun shop owner, who ran the business for more than 30 years, told Fox 5 Atlanta. \u00a0\"I lost someone that I knew very well that brought a lot of joy to my life and my family's life.\" \"How can you hurt someone like that? How can you do that? It\u2019s a sweet old man,\" he said, adding a warning for those responsible. \"I don\u2019t know if the criminals are watching the news, but I hope they are running because they are going to catch them. And I hope they do soon.\" Whitlock, serving the town of just 3,200 people, said he was taking the news pretty hard. \"I\u2019ve been here eight years, and we\u2019ve never had anything like this,\" Whitlock told WSB-TV in a separate interview Saturday morning. \"Right now, I\u2019m just speechless. I have a hard time talking about it because they were friends of ours. I\u2019ve known them for a long time.\" \"It\u2019s really hard because we don\u2019t have stuff like this here in Grantville. This is a nice, quiet little town,\" the police chief said, explaining he last saw the couple Tuesday and law enforcement usually stopped at the shop at least once or twice a week. \"Tommy would do anything for anybody. It\u2019s just a nice family. It\u2019s been really hard.\" Law enforcement agents investigate the scene of a fatal robbery at Lock Stock &amp;amp; Barrel Shooting Range late Friday, April 8, 2022 in Coweta County, Ga., about 50 miles southwest of Atlanta.

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) chooses its words carefully. And when they say, \u201a\u00c4\u00faA regional severe weather outbreak \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including potential for significant/damaging tornadoes \u201a\u00c4\u00ec remains evident,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 they believe a dangerous and robust storm system is taking shape. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSPC Outlooks use phrases such as have been used over the past few days only when environmental conditions appear supportive of more widespread and higher-end severe weather potential,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the SPC, told CNN. The overall storm system was to start Monday in Texas before moving into the Deep South on Tuesday. More than 30 million people are at risk of severe storms capable of producing a tornado through Tuesday. If you live in or near these cities listed below, you want to prepare. This dynamic system has multiple hazards, from huge hail to strong tornadoes. \u201a\u00c4\u00faLong story short is that all variables finally come together for this event,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the National Weather Service (NWS) in New Orleans wrote Monday morning. The last several events have not seen all these severe weather variables working together simultaneously. The combination of warm, humid air clashing with drier air and an intense stream of winds high in the atmosphere is not only causing news organization meteorologists like myself to take notice, but researchers as well. These scientists are deploying today across the South to study this system to learn more about these dangerous storms. The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for parts of central and northern Texas until 10 p.m. CDT Monday. About 14 million residents were under the watch, including people in Austin, Dallas and San Antonio. A tornado watch has been issued for parts of Texas until 10 PM CDT pic.twitter.com/UeCmB0YCML A few tornadoes have the potential to be intense (EF-2 and greater) and storms could produce hail up to 3 inches in diameter and wind gusts to 75 mph, forecasters said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faStorms will begin to fire by noon on Monday and quickly become severe across eastern Texas and much of Oklahoma,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. A slight risk, Level 2 of 5, for severe storms includes portions of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. A higher, enhanced risk, Level 3 of 5, and includes most of the eastern half of Texas. An even higher moderate risk, Level 4 of 5, includes Austin, Texas. After dark, the storms will continue progressing eastward. They will likely line up, charging eastward with all forms of severe weather possible. Before midnight, the strongest weather will approach Little Rock, Shreveport and Houston, Myers said. One thing we will need to pay close attention to, will be the individual storms that form ahead of this line, he adds. They will be east of the line and, therefore, earlier to arrive than the line of storms itself. The individual storms, called supercells, will likely rotate and create the greatest threat of tornadoes, noted Myers. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo, pay attention and watch out for the timing on these!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Read how a storm produces a tornado The storms will continue into Tuesday with even the possibility of a third round into Houston and eastern Texas on Tuesday morning, but our attention will shift eastward to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama throughout the day. The worst of it will be centered in Louisiana and Mississippi, where a moderate risk, Level 4 of 5, includes Baton Rouge in Louisiana and Jackson in Mississippi. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe risk for tomorrow is going to be more so during the daytime, which is a good thing in terms of people being more awake and alert,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Joanne Culin, of the NWS office in Jackson told CNN. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUnfortunately, we will tap into more of that daytime instability and fuel for thunderstorms.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Just to the south of the bull\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s-eye is New Orleans, which is within the enhanced risk, Level 3 of 5. Track the storms \u201a\u00c4\u00faStrong damaging winds,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are possible, said Tim Erickson of the NWS office in New Orleans. \u201a\u00c4\u00faTornadoes will not be out of the question at all,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. This area just north of New Orleans is where scientists are starting to deploy mobile radars, lightning mapping arrays and dozens of more instruments in a joint research project called PERiLS. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur target area is east-central Mississippi and west-central Alabama,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Tony Lyza, coordinator for NOAA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s involvement in PERiLS, told CNN. \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou never let your guard down in the Southeast,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Christopher Weiss, professor of atmospheric science at Texas Tech tells CNN. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not just that they have tornadoes. But there are other factors - you can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t see them very well because of the hills and the trees.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jennifer and I have both gone out in the field with Weiss as he lays out the instruments called sticknets in front of an approaching storm. They look like yellow tripods with devices on top that spin with the wind. He was to lay out 16 instruments on Monday to start capturing wind and pressure data. Then Tuesday, they will monitor the data and as specific storms start to build, and he will deploy eight more in the path of the potential tornadic storm, usually within an area expecting a tornado warning. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAbout an hour or so before the line arrives, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll put out our remaining eight probes, ahead of the line,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he explained. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be dangerous.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 They drive quickly along a highway stopping at a good open spot. All doors swing open as his team gets out of the truck, grabbing a sticknet out of the trailer, running it out, unfolding it. One team member running with a hammer starts staking it into the ground. Another grabs and attaches the instruments and transmitter. Then, they run back to the truck. As Jenn and I ran with them years ago, you can feel your heart racing as you pull your seat belt across your chest. Then they race on to another location down the road, trying to deploy all eight. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe need to be very careful, of course, about the storm that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s approaching, the tornado threat, of course, but also the lightning,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. Tomorrow, he won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be the only scientist in the field. A group of them from nine universities, three divisions of NOAA and the NSF are coming together Tuesday to get a better understanding of dangerous tornadic storms. Look, we as meteorologists cringe anytime we hear someone interviewed after a tornado say these words: \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt came without warning.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The National Weather Service does an incredible job issuing warnings ahead of time. Not to mention days out, they begin telling people the likelihood of severe storms. The stronger, more intense tornadoes typically happen from supercells, forming ahead of the main line of storms. They are easy to depict on radar and in a sense, are easier to give people warning on. Know the difference between a tornado watch and a warning But the group is studying tornadoes that can form within a line of storms. \u201a\u00c4\u00faTornadoes can spin up, and they tend to spin up with very little warning, sometimes even a short enough timespan that it gets in between the radar scans for the weather service,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Weiss pointed out. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to be focused on here is trying to try to learn more about how tornadoes are spawned from these linear storms, especially.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faA lot of these tornadoes tend to happen at night, of course. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s part of what makes this part of the country so appealing for this type of project because there are so many different ways that the storms can affect people out there.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Both Monday night and Tuesday night, there will be a risk of nocturnal tornadoes, which is an incredibly dangerous scenario. People can be caught off guard when the alerts wake them up in the middle of the night. \u201a\u00c4\u00faPeople, you know of course sleeping, need a way to wake up whenever your alarm goes off for severe weather,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Erickson said. How to prepare for severe weather He thinks there will be a line somewhere around New Orleans, which will be a threat there before or around midnight, and possibly even into the morning hours. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not just the dark that could keep you from seeing the tornado coming. The air is so moist in the South, rain often wraps around tornadoes, and it can be hard to see them. Heavy rainfall will make it extremely difficult to observe tornadoes as tornadoes will potentially become rain-wrapped fairly quickly, the Dallas NWS said. The WPC has also issued a moderate risk, Level 3 of 4, for extreme rainfall for many of the same areas that could see tornadoes today and tomorrow. It means, beyond rain-wrapped tornadoes, there will be the threat of flash flooding from Texas to Alabama. Flood watches have been issued along the Gulf Coast states from Texas to Mississippi on Monday, and they could expand into Alabama later today. The flood threat will be highest where storms train over the same areas \u201a\u00c4\u00faand drop a tremendous amount of rainfall and locally up to six inches or more is certainly not out of the question,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the NWS office in Shreveport said Monday.

Lizelle Herrera spent three days in jail after allegedly causing \"the death of an individual\" via abortion. But on Sunday, Starr County District Attorney Gocha Allen Ramirez said it was \"clear\" Ms Herrera could not be prosecuted under Texas law. Last year, Texas barred abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It is still unclear whether Ms Herrera was accused of having an abortion, assisting someone else with an abortion, or how far along the pregnancy had been. Texas law exempts pregnant women from being charged with murder in connection with \"the death of an unborn child\". Ms Herrera was arrested on Friday and detained in Starr County, in southern Texas, a local sheriff's official said. Frontera Fund, an abortion rights organisation, said she was released on $500,000 (\u00a3383,500) bail the next day. In a statement on Saturday, the sheriff's office said Ms Herrera was arrested and served with an indictment on the charge of murder after she \"intentionally and knowingly [caused] the death of an individual by self-induced abortion\". On Sunday, District Attorney Ramirez said that, after reviewing applicable Texas law, it became clear she could not be prosecuted for murder. He added: \"The events leading up to this indictment have taken a toll on Ms Harrera and her family. To ignore this fact would be short-sighted.\" The near-total abortion ban in Texas is among the most restrictive in the country. The law is enforced by giving any individual - from Texas or elsewhere - the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point. However, it does not allow the women who get the procedure to be sued. Last year, Texas also narrowed the window in which doctors are able to give abortion-inducing drugs to people up to 10 weeks into pregnancy and barred mailing such medication. In most states in the US, abortions are prohibited after the point of foetal viability - the point at which a foetus could survive outside the womb, usually at about 24 weeks. But several states - like Texas - have barred the procedure much earlier in pregnancy in anticipation of a Supreme Court ruling that may overturn the landmark legal decision guaranteeing the right to abortion in the US. The Supreme Court in June will rule on a Mississippi law that would bar abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, even in cases of rape or incest.

Has he done permanent damage to his image and career, and what might happen next? As the Oscars ended on Sunday night, Will Smith may have hoped he had nipped the fallout from his slap in the bud. His tearful best actor acceptance speech, in which he apologised to the Academy and his fellow nominees and tried to frame himself as a \"defender of his family\", received a standing ovation. He later made a show of posing and dancing with his best actor statuette at the after-show party in classic Big Willie style, as if nothing had happened. Or as if he was relieved to have ridden out the storm. But when he woke the next morning, the storm hadn't passed. It only intensified as people took stock of his violent behaviour in the cold light of day. \"It is kind of crazy to think that this one incident could wipe away so many decades of goodwill,\" says The Wrap editor-in-chief Sharon Waxman. \"But it was so public, it was so outside of the box. One agent we talked to called it a 'stunning act of narcissism'. The movie star brand for Will Smith is badly tarnished.\" Her website has published an article asking film industry insiders if Smith's career is \"mortally wounded\". \"The conclusion is, yeah,\" Waxman says. \"'Mortally wounded' is a quote, that's what one of the agents we talked to called it, and said he's kind of done as an A-list movie star. \"The idea that people still relate to Will Smith and feel like he's somebody they want to look up to, and they want to admire, and pretend that - hey, that could be me up there on the screen - there's a real sense that that relatability has been taken away with this gesture.\" Kim Masters, editor-at-large of the Hollywood Reporter, agrees Smith - known for hits like Men In Black, Independence Day and Bad Boys - has done huge damage to his image. \"He's built a persona over many, many years, and this was a complete break from that persona,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"People were absolutely shocked by his comportment and subsequently a rather peculiar acceptance speech and then dancing as if he had not a care in the world at the Vanity Fair party. So this is a big change of what people know and expect from Will Smith.\" The 53-year-old star had no history of causing trouble and was known to be generous with fellow cast members, she added. \"But nonetheless, many people have said they can't look at him the same again.\" What can we expect from him in the coming months? There may be charity work, a public announcement of therapy or anger management, and the obligatory confessional interview - perhaps even on his family's Facebook chat show Red Table Talk. That is where he and wife Jada Pinkett Smith came clean about their relationship issues in 2020, which is the closest he has come to scandal in the past. It is also where Pinkett Smith opened up about her alopecia - the hair loss condition that was at the nub of her husband's Oscars outburst - and where Kevin Hart talked about quitting as host of the 2019 Oscars. Smith also has a number of films in the pipeline that have now been thrown into uncertainty. They include Bad Boys 4, Bright 2 and Apple's Emancipation, in which he plays a runaway slave. \"A big indicator of how tarnished Will Smith's reputation is [will come] when we see what Apple decides to do with this movie,\" Waxman says. \"Everybody thought it would come out the second half of the year and be in contention for awards for next year, and we don't know what Apple's going to do. \"If they decide to push it [back], I think that'll give you some strong sense of, they don't want to be out in the marketplace with Will Smith this year.\" Other Hollywood stars who have fallen from grace may offer clues about what comes next, even if the circumstances of their behaviour differ. Johnny Depp lost his role in the third Fantastic Beasts film after losing a libel case over a newspaper article that called him a wife beater. But he kept his Christian Dior adverts and a die-hard fanbase who have continued to support him at every turn. He has also just been cast in his first film since the libel trial, a French production in which he will play Louis XV. Mel Gibson has been hit by scandal more than once, admitting a drunken anti-Semitic outburst in 2006, and in 2010 when leaked tapes emerged of a tirade including racist insults against his then-girlfriend, who accused him of physical abuse. He was eventually welcomed back by Hollywood - and was nominated for an Oscar in 2017. Smith's career may be wounded but, if he can reconcile with Hollywood, it's not necessarily over. The final words of his acceptance speech on Sunday were: \"I hope the Academy invites me back.\" The chances of him being asked to present the best actress award at the 2023 Oscars - as the previous year's best actor winner would traditionally do - appear slim. But it's also unlikely that he will be forced to hand back the golden statuette he won on Sunday. Oscars organisers introduced a new code of conduct in 2017 in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Harvey Weinstein and Roman Polanski were expelled from the Academy as a result, but even they were not stripped of their Oscars. Former ceremony host Whoopi Goldberg, who is one of three governors in the Academy's acting branch, said last week: \"We're not going to take that Oscar from him. \"There will be consequences, I'm sure, but I don't think that's what they're going to do, particularly because Chris [Rock] said, 'Listen, I'm not pressing any charges.'\" Police did not arrest Smith after consulting Rock on the night, but have said they could file a report at a later date if the comedian changes his mind. The Academy started disciplinary proceedings against Smith last week, with expulsion and suspension among the possible punishments. But Smith took matters into his own hands on Friday when he resigned his membership. Despite that, Academy bosses said their disciplinary proceedings would continue and will discuss any further action on 18 April. In his resignation letter, the actor hinted that he wants to move forward, saying he is \"committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason\". But he also made clear that the gravity of his actions has now fully sunk in, acknowledging how \"shocking, painful and inexcusable\" they were.

Dr. Harry Jackson, a father and former naval intelligence officer, opposed the policy at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria that based admissions more on race and less on merit. Steve Descano, a Democratic prosecutor backed by billionaire George Soros, pursued criminal charges of libel and slander against Jackson over tweets published in 2020. UVA STUDENT PUSHES BACK AFTER SCHOOL PAPER CALLS FOR MIKE PENCE EVENT TO BE CANCELED FOR \u2018VIOLENT RHETORIC' Jackson, also a professor at numerous other universities and the African American Community Liaison for Fairfax GOP, had accused liberal activist Jorge Torrico of \"grooming\" behavior. Torrico, a member of the TJ Alumni Action Group, which supported the elimination of standardized testing and written teacher recommendation requirements for admission to the magnet school, was spotted speaking with a high school senior and student government president after a PTA meeting. Jackson took issue with Torrico allegedly seeking meetings and other bicyling outings with minors without parents present.

In this day and age, I believe it is the only case of its kind,\" the attorney said via email Sunday. \"Freedom of speech is paramount to our Republic. Both my client and I realize this. We were not willing to show any concessions on this issue. We fought for my client's constitutional rights and the representative constitutional rights of every other individual who might find themselves being criminally prosecuted for voicing an opinion or a concern.\" Descano aimed at dropping prosecution, but Medvin sought to have the charges dismissed by a Fairfax County judge in order to \"restore the public's trust in the First Amendment.\" \"This should never have happened. But a magistrate allowed it to happen\u2014four times,\" Medvin told Newsweek in a separate interview Friday, describing Descano as a \"Soros-funded prosecutor.\" The separate but related case involving the school admissions policy, which a federal judge previously ruled as discriminatory against Asian Americans, is also piquing the interest of the Supreme Court.

Last week the former Empire star, 39, was found guilty of lying to police and sentenced to 150 days in prison. Following his sentencing, his lawyers launched an appeal. Smollett has always maintained the hoax incident, which took place in Chicago in 2019, was real. He had to sign a $150,000 (\u00a3114,000) recognizance bond prior to his release and made no comment as he left Cook County jail surrounded by security. But his defence team said they were \"very, very happy\" with the appeal justices' ruling and said Smollett was the target of a racist justice system, CBS News reports. His team argued his imprisonment - for what was described as a low-level, non-violent crime - was excessive and that his health and safety were in danger while he remained in prison. They also questioned why he had been imprisoned after a previous prosecutor dropped the charges against him in 2019. \"Regardless of what you think about this case... the real question is, should black men be walked into jail for a Class 4 felony? Shame on you if you think they should, that's a disgrace,\" his defence attorney Nenye Uche is quoted as saying in The Chicago Tribune. The prosecuting office said the claim that his health and safety were at risk was incorrect as he had been in protective custody while in prison. The ruling stemmed from an incident three years ago when Smollett said he was attacked by two assailants. The actor, who is black and gay, said the attackers had shouted slurs and a Trump slogan, dumped a \"chemical substance\" on him and tied a noose around his neck while he was walking late at night in January 2019. Police opened an investigation into the incident but later charged Smollett with filing a false police report, saying he had staged the assault.

Delta Air Lines head Ed Bastian told the BBC the final impact \"really depends where fuel prices settle\". Oil prices have reached 14-year highs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Emirates, Japan Airlines and AirAsia are among the big carriers to introduce surcharges on their tickets recently to cover the higher cost of jet fuel. Before the pandemic, in 2019, 200 million customers flew on Delta, making it the world's second biggest airline by passenger numbers. Mr Bastian said that on a domestic US flight the rise in fuel prices \"is probably about $25 on a ticket, that could be anywhere between 5% to 10% at these high levels of oil... and international [flights] will be a bit higher than that\". Delta is planning to introduce fuel surcharges on the international flights which account for about 35% of its business, and increase US ticket prices. Jet fuel is one of the biggest costs for airlines.

Many airlines try to protect themselves from these changes by buying fuel in advance. Easyjet and British Airways both said recently that they had done so for 60% of their fuel needs this year. This year has seen big fluctuations. At the start of January, Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil - was under $80 a barrel, but it recently reached as high as almost $130 as the US and UK said they would end their use of oil from the world's biggest exporter, Russia. More price swings are likely in the short-term according to the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Dr Fatih Birol. He told the BBC: \"I think the $100 [oil] we are experiencing today may not be the highest level of prices we'll be seeing in the next weeks\". He warns that will be felt across all areas of the global economy, because as well as higher transport costs it will lead to more expensive heating and electricity. That would exacerbate the cost of living crisis many countries are facing. Reports from India suggest it is considering tackling high prices at the petrol pumps by buying discounted Russian oil. Many won't purchase it because of western sanctions, and Dr Birol warned: \"One shouldn't forget that every single dollar for oil going to [the] Russian economy will go back as a tank or as a bullet to Ukrainian people. One shouldn't forget this moral aspect in my view\". Instead he wants Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia to increase oil production. The latest IEA forecast says three million barrels a day of Russian oil could be removed from the market. However, that drop in supply could be offset by a fall in demand from China where Covid has led to new lockdowns.

The Delta chief is also looking to a future where initiatives to tackle climate change by cutting aviation's carbon emissions mean oil prices are less of a concern. \"The existing fossil fuel and jet fuel technology needs to go, and we need to make those investments for the future towards a sustainable future.\" This means moving towards sustainable fuels such as biofuels or synthetic alternatives made through chemical processes. Mr Bastian says that cost is the big impediment, with the production of such substitutes costing \"three to five times what's in the marketplace today\". The difference will need to be made by governments investing in scaling up production. \"Scale will bring costs down over time, and will bring more capital from private sources into exploration and looking for new technology. This next five years is critical that to make sure we get government support, not just in the US but around the world.\" Returning to profitability after the losses of the pandemic will also help fund the development of new technologies. According to the International Air Transport Association the industry lost more than $51bn last year with global demand 58.4% down on 2019 levels. As Covid restrictions continue to ease, Delta had two record days of sales last week, leading Mr Bastian to be hopeful about the outlook. \"The world is returning to travel and governments have decided that Covid is done.\" \"We're seeing some of our largest bookings we've ever had in our history. And it's not just in the US, it's internationally as well.\" However, he adds that Asia is lagging behind other regions. Crucially demand for lucrative business class fares is also returning. It is currently at about 60% of pre-pandemic levels, but Mr Bastian expects this to rise to 70% by the summer. He concedes \"there's forms of business travel that will never return, that are more efficient to handle over video technology\", but adds that leisure travellers are now showing more willingness to splash out on premium services. Last year Delta recorded a pre-tax loss of $3.4bn and the disruption caused by coronavirus at the start of this year means Mr Bastian thinks that will be added to at the start of this year. \"We will lose some money primarily because of Omicron, it's not fuel prices. But I do expect starting in the second quarter and beyond that we'll be profitable.\" You can watch Ed Bastian and Dr Fatih Birol's full interviews on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend.

Mr Putin has warned his allies for many years they should protect themselves against such measures, particularly as relations soured with the US and EU countries after the annexation of Crimea. But while some of those closest to him took his advice and remained invested in Russia, others kept their money in palatial properties overseas and football clubs, and their companies remained listed on foreign stock exchanges. They now find themselves scrambling to hold on to their assets amid the most comprehensive economic penalties imposed in the modern era. Here's what we know about some of them. SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK Said to be one of Mr Putin's favourite oligarchs, Alisher Usmanov is also one of the richest, worth an estimated $17.6bn, according to Forbes. A former professional fencer, the EU describes him as a \"businessman-official\" who helps the president solve his business problems. Born in Uzbekistan while it was still part of the Soviet Union, he runs USM Holdings, a huge conglomerate that involves mining and telecoms, including Russia's second biggest mobile network MegaFon. The EU announced sanctions against him on 28 February, and the US and UK have followed suit. He has called the sanctions unfair and said all the allegations against him were false. USM Holdings appears to be hoping to avoid EU sanctions as he owns just under 50% of the shares. His superyacht Dilbar, named after his mother, is undergoing a refit in Hamburg and is at risk of being seized. In the UK, his main visible investments are in property. In London he owns Beechwood House, a \u00a365m country house with grounds in the heart of the city, and just outside London in Surrey, he owns a Tudor mansion, Sutton Place. Both have been frozen by UK authorities. His business partner Farhad Moshiri owns Everton, and Mr Usmanov's companies USM, MegaFon and Yota have been key sponsors at the club, with suggestions his involvement was even closer. Everton suspended the sponsorship deal last week, and Mr Moshiri quit as a USM board member. SANCTIONED BY: UK, EU One of the most high-profile Russian billionaires because of the phenomenal success of his football club Chelsea FC, Roman Abramovich was sanctioned later than some others, possibly because he is less obviously influential than other Putin allies. How influential he is in the Kremlin is much debated. Some suggest he is merely tolerated by Mr Putin, but the UK believes the two are close and that Mr Abramovich has made money out of the relationship, being awarded lucrative contracts for the FIFA 2018 World Cup in Russia, for example. Mr Abramovich strongly denies having close ties to Mr Putin or the Kremlin, but\u00a0the UK portion of\u00a0his\u00a0estimated $12.4bn fortune\u00a0is\u00a0now frozen. Just before the UK sanctions were announced, he put Chelsea up for sale for \u00a33bn. His \u00a3150m house in London's Kensington Palace Gardens in London was also reportedly up for sale. Mr Abramovich made his money in the 1990s and was one of the original oligarchs during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. His biggest break was buying the oil company Sibneft at a knockdown price. His assets include the third-longest yacht in the world, Eclipse, which recently left the British Virgin Isles, heading east across the Atlantic. His other\u00a0mega-yacht, Solaris, is in the Mediterranean. He had started to withdraw from the UK in recent years. In 2018 he decided not to apply to renew his UK visa, and has instead been using his newly acquired Israeli passport to visit London. And while he used to go to every Chelsea home game, in recent years he was rarely seen at Stamford Bridge - and now he is banned from entering the UK. SANCTIONED BY: US, UK When President Putin came to power, Oleg Deripaska was immensely rich, his wealth peaking at about $28bn - but he is now thought to be worth a mere $3bn. He fought his way to a fortune in the 1990s, coming out on top in a vicious battle for the aluminium industry. The US said he was involved in money laundering, bribery, extortion and racketeering, and reported allegations that he had \"ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group\". He denies the allegations. He suffered badly in the 2008 financial crisis and needed Mr Putin to bail him out. In 2009, President Putin humiliated him by suggesting publicly that he had stolen a pen. Since then, he seems to have worked himself back into favour and was described in the Mueller report - a US investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election - as being \"closely aligned\" with the president. When it announced its sanctions, the UK also described him as closely associated with Mr Putin. He founded a green energy and metals company, En+ Group, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, but  reduced his stake in it to below 50% when he was subjected to US sanctions in 2018. At the time, one of Mr Deripaska's companies, Basic Element, released a statement calling the sanctions \"groundless, ridiculous and absurd\". He owns a vast art deco property, Hamstone House in Weybridge, Surrey, which he has been trying to sell for \u00a318m but has now been taken off the market. He also owns a yacht, Clio, which was recently seen in the Maldives. Unlike many sanctioned oligarchs Mr Deripaska has been vocal about his view on the war, taking to social media to call for peace. \"Negotiations need to start as soon as possible!\" he wrote. SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK Igor Sechin's connections to Vladimir Putin run long and deep, according to the EU which announced sanctions against him on 28 February. He is said to be one of Mr Putin's most trusted and closest advisors, as well as a personal friend, and the two are thought to be in daily contact. His progress was made through ruthlessly pushing aside opponents - his nickname in the Russian press is Darth Vader. A leaked US embassy cable from 2008 described him as \"so shadowy that it was joked he may not actually exist but rather was a sort of urban myth, a bogeyman, invented by the Kremlin to instil fear\". The US imposed sanctions on him in 2014, which he called \"totally unjustified and illegal\". They announced new sanctions against him on 24 February. Mr Sechin has spent his career alternating between jobs in politics and business, sometimes holding senior jobs in both at the same time. When Putin was prime minister, he was a deputy prime minister, and now runs the state oil giant Rosneft. Mr Sechin worked with Mr Putin in the mayor's office in St Petersburg in the 1990s, and is widely believed to have been in the much-feared intelligence service, the KGB, although has never openly admitted it. Based in Russia, no-one knows how much money Mr Sechin has, but the French have seized a yacht called Amore Vero that was linked to him after his second wife Olga Sechina kept posting photographs of herself on board. They have since divorced. Beyond that there is little sign he has substantial wealth overseas that could be easily uncovered, and it may be hard to track down and freeze any more of his assets. SANCTIONED BY: US, UK Alexey Miller is another old friend of Vladimir Putin's. Something of a grey man, he too has built his career on loyalty to the president, starting when he was Mr Putin's deputy on the foreign relations committee of the St Petersburg mayor's office in the 1990s. He has run the immensely powerful state-owned gas company Gazprom since 2001, but it was a surprise appointment and it is widely assumed that he is just carrying out the orders of his old boss. The US ambassador to Moscow in 2009 described Gazprom as \"inefficient, politically driven, and corrupt\". Mr Miller was not sanctioned after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but when he was added to the list in the US in 2018, he said he was proud. \"Not being included in the first list. I even had some doubts - maybe something is wrong? But I am finally included. This means we are doing everything right,\" he said. He does not appear to have easily traceable assets outside Russia and there is no information about his net worth. SANCTIONED BY: EU, UK The EU describes Pyotr Aven (pictured on the left) as one of President Putin's closest oligarchs, and Mikhail Fridman as an enabler of Putin's inner circle. Together the two men created Alfa-Bank, the largest private bank in Russia. The Mueller report said Mr Aven met with Putin in the Kremlin about four times a year, saying he \"understood any suggestions or critiques Putin made during these meetings were implicit directives, and there would be consequences for Aven if he did not follow through\". They were warned by Mr Putin in 2016 to protect their interests from future sanctions. This week the pair stood down from the London-headquartered LetterOne investment group they founded almost 10 years ago because their shares were frozen by EU sanctions on 28 February. Mr Aven also stood down as a trustee of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. The two businessmen said they would \"contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions - vigorously and through all means available to them\". Mr Fridman, thought to be worth around $12bn, lives in London in a house next to Lord's Cricket Ground and also owns a huge property, Athlone House in north London, that he paid \u00a365m for in 2016. At a London press conference on 1 March, he said the Ukraine war was a \"huge tragedy\" but would not criticise the Kremlin directly saying to do so could put the jobs of hundreds of thousands of employees at risk.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "context": "is-biased"}]}
