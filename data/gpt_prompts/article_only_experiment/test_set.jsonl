Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Navy that once wanted smaller, speedy warships to chase down pirates has made a speedy pivot to Russia and China \u2013 and many of those recently built ships could be retired. The U.S. Navy wants to decommission nine ships in the Freedom-class of littoral combat ships \u2013 warships that cost about $4.5 billion to build. THE PENTAGON IS INVESTIGATING EXTREMISM IN THE MILITARY. HERE\u2019S HOW BAD THE PROBLEM IS The Navy contends in its budget proposal that the move would free up $50 million per ship annually for other priorities. But it would also reduce the size of the fleet that\u2019s already surpassed by China in sheer numbers, something that could cause members of Congress to balk. Adm. Mike Gilday, chief of naval operations, defended the proposal that emphasizes long-range weapons and modern warships, while shedding other ships ill-equipped to face current threats.

BIDENS HONOR THE NAVY'S NEW SUBMARINE AT CEREMONY FOR USS DELAWARE All told, the Navy wants to scrap 24 ships, including five cruisers and a pair of Los Angeles-class submarines, as part of its cost-cutting needed to maintain the existing fleet and build modern warships. Those cuts surpass the proposed nine ships to be built. Most of them are older vessels. However, the littoral combat ships that are targeted are young. The oldest of them is 10 years old. NAVY IDS OFFICER KILLED IN E-2D HAWKEYE CRASH OFF VIRGINIA The littoral combat ship program was announced after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The ships topped 50 mph (80 kph) \u2013 fast enough to chase down pirates \u2013 and were highly maneuverable, even in shallow water, thanks to steerable waterjets instead of propellers. The ships were supposed to be made versatile through plug-and-play mission modules for surface combat, mine-sweeping operations or anti-submarine warfare. But those mission modules were beset by problems, and the anti-submarine capability was canceled in the new budget.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) And what about that speed? The fastest ship can\u2019t outrun missiles, and firing up those marine turbines for an extra burst of speed turned the ships into gas guzzlers, analysts said. Early versions also were criticized as too lightly armed and armored to survive combat. The speedy Freedom-class ships proposed for decommissioning feature a traditional steel hull. That entire class of ships suffers from a propulsion defect that will be costly to repair. The Navy proposes keeping a second variant, the aluminum Independence class. SUPREME COURT WON'T PROTECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, BUT NAVY SEALS NEVER QUIT U.S. Senate Armed Services Chair Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said the program was plagued by troubles from the start, and that \"moving forward the Navy must avoid similar acquisition disasters.\" U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Virginia, was more blunt, tweeting that it \"sucks\" to be decommissioning so many ships, especially newer ones. \"The Navy owes a public apology to American taxpayers for wasting tens of billions of dollars on ships they now say serve no purpose,\" she said. A sailor salutes from the USS Sioux City during the ship's commissioning ceremony, Nov. 17, 2018, in Annapolis, Maryland. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) Some detractors proclaimed littoral combat ships to be the Navy\u2019s \"Little Crappy Ship,\" but that\u2019s not fair, said defense analyst Loren Thompson. \"It\u2019s not a little crappy ship. It does what it was supposed to do. What it was supposed to do isn\u2019t enough for the kind of threats that we face today,\" said Thompson, from the Lexington Institute. In the Navy\u2019s defense, threats shifted swiftly from the Cold War to the war on terror to the current Great Power Competition in which Russia and China are asserting themselves, he said. NAVY AIRCRAFT CRASHES IN VIRGINIA WATERS; TWO RESCUED, ONE CONFIRMED DEAD: REPORT In the end, the Navy may be content with smaller numbers of Freedom-class ships for maritime security and small surface combatant operations, said Bryan Clark, defense analyst at the Hudson Institute. Congress must sign off on the Navy\u2019s proposal to decommission ships ahead of their projected service life. The House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday grilled Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the proposal.

Branch/U.S. Navy via AP, File) U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., suggested the ship cuts were \"grossly irresponsible\" when the U.S. Navy has dipped from 318 ships to 297, while the Chinese fleet has grown from 210 to 360 ships over the past two decades. Milley said it\u2019s important to focus on the Navy\u2019s capabilities rather than the size of its fleet.

Prescribing a rigid approach to what must be \u201a\u00c4\u00f2taught\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 in those discussions will lessen if not erase them.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 SB1 states in part that public schools shall provide instructions that align with certain concepts including: \u201a\u00c4\u00faAn individual, by virtue of the individual\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed by other members of the same race or sex;\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe understanding that the institution of slavery and post-Civil War laws enforcing racial segregation and discrimination were contrary to the fundamental American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, but that defining racial disparities solely on the legacy of this institution is destructive to the unification of our nation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In his letter, Beshear said that children and adults must be able to exercise their First Amendment rights and have important discussions free of government censorship. The bill received final passage from the state Senate last month, according to the Kentucky General Assembly page on SB 1. Kentucky's Democratic governor vetoes anti-trans sports ban Although the legislation does not implicitly use the term critical race theory, the bill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s language shares similarities with other measures passed in Republican-controlled states. Samuel Crankshaw, communications manager for the ACLU of Kentucky, said Wednesday that SB 1 is \u201a\u00c4\u00fapart of a nationwide strategy to whitewash history, perpetuate white supremacy, and erase marginalized people \u201a\u00c4\u00ec particularly people of color and LGBTQ people. They would also deny educators and students their First Amendment right to free speech.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beshear notes that the bill would require teachers to incorporate \u201a\u00c4\u00faa specific set of historical documents and speeches\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 into lectures. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThese texts were not selected by historians or scholars, but by a political body.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 One of the required texts is Ronald Reagan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 1964 political campaign speech \u201a\u00c4\u00faA Time For Choosing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Beshear said. \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe fact that this text is included over others like Dwight Eisenhower\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement to troops in advance of the D-Day invasion suggests the bill is aimed more at politics than at history.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The House passed the current version of the bill with a vote of 67-29 and the Senate passed the bill 21-15-1.

Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, Brandon Caserta, 33, and Barry Croft, 46, each faced a kidnapping conspiracy charge. Mr Harris and Mr Caserta were found not guilty, but the charges against Mr Fox and Mr Croft ended in mistrial. The government had argued they targeted Gretchen Whitmer, 50, in a 2020 plot. Jurors began deliberating this week after 14 days of testimony and had indicated earlier on Friday that they were deadlocked on some of the charges. They ultimately reached no verdict against Mr Fox,  who was alleged to be the group's ringleader, and Mr Croft, both of whom were also facing an additional count each of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. In a statement sent by her office on Friday, Governor Whitmer thanked prosecutors and law enforcement for their work on the case and warned that \"Michiganders and Americans - especially our children - are living through the normalisation of political violence\". According to secret chats and private conversations revealed in court, members of the group - some of whom were said to be militia members - viewed Ms Whitmer as a \"tyrant\". Prosecutors said the men planned to abduct her from her holiday home, conduct some kind of \"treason trial\" and set her adrift in a boat on Lake Michigan. But lawyers for the accused countered that the scheme was mostly \"smoke and mirrors\", profane talk by angry and disillusioned men. Throughout the trial, they maintained that the men had been entrapped - or improperly induced into the crime - by an undercover FBI operation. The FBI has said it began tracking the group's movements after spotting online discussions of political violence. According to an FBI affidavit, an undercover source attended a June 2020 meeting in Ohio, where a group of Michigan-based militia members discussed overthrowing state governments \"that they believed were violating the US Constitution\". That October, the bureau announced the arrests of 13 alleged plotters. On the witness stand, two of the men - Ty Garbin, 26, and Kaleb Franks, 27 - said the participants acted of their own volition and were free to leave the group whenever they wanted. Both men had taken plea deals to avoid a prison sentence. FBI agent Timothy \"Red\" Bates also took the stand, testifying that the group discussed blowing up bridges near the governor's house to thwart law enforcement. But the defence alleged an FBI informant named Daniel \"Big Dan\" Chappel who infiltrated the group acted as a \"double agent\", befriending and radicalising the men to advance the plot. Mr Harris - the only defendant of the four to take the stand - slammed Big Dan as \"a liar\" who \"got scared by memes\" shared within the group. Mr Fox's lawyer also attacked Big Dan for \"[beating] the drum and [getting] them all worked up\".\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is_not_biased"}]}

Jackson said that she was a beneficiary of the Civil Rights Act passed in the decade before she was born, hardworking parents who gave her an African name \u201a\u00c4\u00ec \u201a\u00c4\u00faKetanji Onyika\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00falovely one\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and those who came before her, including Judge Constance Baker Motley, the first African American woman to be appointed to the federal bench. But Jackson, like some previous Supreme Court nominees, gave little hint of her personal judicial philosophy, saying she decides cases \u201a\u00c4\u00fafrom a neutral posture\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and interprets the law \u201a\u00c4\u00fawithout fear or favor, consistent with my judicial oath.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and the grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Jackson. Democrats touted President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pick as a qualified, boundary-breaking nominee, while some Republicans criticized her record on crime and the support she holds from left-wing groups. Jackson, 51, sits on DC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement. Jackson worked as a clerk for Breyer, a federal public defender, an attorney in private practice, a federal district court judge and a member of the US Sentencing Commission. At the hearing Monday, Jackson and the senators delivered their opening statements establishing the arguments for and against her confirmation. She was introduced by Judge Thomas Griffith, formerly of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Lisa Fairfax, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, her daughters Leila and Talia, and her husband Patrick were sitting behind her. Jackson will answer questions from the members on Tuesday and Wednesday, and witnesses will testify on Thursday. Democrats hope to confirm Jackson by early April. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, opened the hearing by putting Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination in historical context, noting that of 115 Supreme Court justices, 108 have been white men. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot a single justice has been a Black woman,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Durbin said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou, Judge Jackson, can be the first.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not easy being the first,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut your presence here today, your willingness to brave this process, will give inspiration to millions of Americans who see themselves in you.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 No Democratic senators have signaled they will oppose Jackson, and some Republicans have expressed openness to supporting her. In the 50-50 Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris could break a tied vote and confirm Jackson to the Supreme Court. READ: Ketanji Brown Jackson's opening statement at her Supreme Court confirmation hearing But many Republican senators are expected to oppose the nomination and some preemptively defended themselves from any criticisms that voting against Jackson would be perceived as sexist or racist, noting that Democrats have opposed diverse picks in the past because of their judicial philosophy. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be looking to see whether Judge Jackson is committed to the Constitution as originally understood,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Republicans previewed on Monday their attempts to portray Jackson as weak on crime. Grassley said in his opening statement that there are two types of nominees who have worked criminal cases: \u201a\u00c4\u00faBill of Rights attorneys who want to protect defendants\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 constitutional rights\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facriminal defense lawyers who disagree with our criminal laws.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faOf course, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a very important difference,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Grassley said. Some Republican senators indicated that they will press Jackson for advocating on behalf of detainees at Guant\u221a\u00b0namo Bay in private practice after representing them as a public defender. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m a bit troubled by some of the positions you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve taken and arguments that you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made representing people who have committed terrorist acts against the United States and other dangerous criminals,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has raised concerns about Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s record on sentencing in child pornography cases. Hawley said on Twitter last week that there is \u201a\u00c4\u00faan alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s treatment of sex offenders, especially those preying on children.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Democrats have refuted Republicans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attacks since her nomination. When Biden gave a speech announcing his pick in February, he made sure to note that Jackson came from \u201a\u00c4\u00faa family of law enforcement, with her brother and uncles having served as police officers.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 GOP senators push misleading portrayal of Ketanji Brown Jackson's record on child porn cases The White House and Senate Democrats have pushed back on Hawley\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attack, noting that Jackson has the support of law enforcement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police, and dozens of former state attorneys general. They noted she has already been confirmed by the Senate three times. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn the vast majority of cases involving child sex crimes, the sentences Judge Jackson imposed were consistent with or above what the government or US probation recommended,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. A CNN review of the material in question shows that Jackson has mostly followed the common judicial sentencing practices in these kinds of cases and that Hawley took some of her comments out of context by suggesting they were opinions, rather than follow-up questions to subject-matter experts. It has become a norm among judges to issue sentences below the guidelines in certain child pornography cases that don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t involve producing the pornography itself. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSome have said that the federal sentencing guidelines are too harsh on child sex crimes, especially child pornography,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Hawley on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll just be honest. I can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say that I agree with that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 There are other matters Republicans may probe. During Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s confirmation hearings last year, some Senate Republicans focused on a 2019 case she heard between the House Judiciary Committee, which was looking into then-President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s possible obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Russia investigation, and former White House counsel Don McGahn. Ongoing cases involving Trump and the powers of government could land before her on the Supreme Court, including disputes over whether Congress can access Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial records and whether Trump could be held accountable by private litigants for the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Last year, Grassley challenged Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s declaration that \u201a\u00c4\u00fapresidents are not kings\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and suggested she was engaged in a kind of hyperbole. Senate Republicans have also pushed for Jackson to publicly oppose efforts to expand the court, which activists on the left have called for since they blocked then-President Barack Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 and then expanded, under Trump, the high court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conservative majority from 5-4 to 6-3. Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination to replace another liberal will not change the ideological balance of the court. Confirmation hearings to spotlight rightward trajectory of America's highest court \u201a\u00c4\u00faNine is a number that works,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe must protect the court.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Still, even those who may oppose Jackson expect the hearings this week to be less contentious than those in the Trump era, which altered the balance of the court and, in the case of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, centered on allegations of sexual assault. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMost of us couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go back to our offices during Kavanaugh without getting spit on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Graham to his Democratic colleagues. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI hope that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t happen to y\u201a\u00c4\u00f4all. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think it will.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jackson may receive some votes from Republicans. Last year, she received three \u201a\u00c4\u00ec from Graham, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u201a\u00c4\u00ec confirming her to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Graham preferred for Biden to choose Judge J. Michelle Childs from his home state and criticized the President for picking another Ivy League-educated nominee, claiming on Monday that Childs would\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve received \u201a\u00c4\u00fa60-plus\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 votes, including from himself. Jackson went to a public high school in Miami before earning both her undergraduate degree and law degree at Harvard University. Graham, like other Republicans, criticized Jackson for holding the support of left-wing groups. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNow we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re facing a choice sponsored by the most radical elements of the Democratic party when it comes to how to be a judge,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Graham said. Murkowski has said that her previous support of Jackson to be a judge does not signal how she would vote for Jackson to be a justice. But Collins has praised Jackson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s credentials and experience as \u201a\u00c4\u00faimpressive.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Maine Republican said she would not make her decision until after the Judiciary Committee hearings.

The regulation on so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00faghost guns\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec unregulated, untraceable weapons made from kits \u201a\u00c4\u00ec will address a critical gap in the government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to track them by requiring background checks before purchase and serial numbers on some of the components. Though ghost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement, they have been seen with increasing frequency in recent years. Biden brought one of the kits to the Rose Garden on Monday, declaring the new rules \u201a\u00c4\u00fabasic common sense\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 before holding aloft one of the weapons made from the gear. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you buy a couch you have to assemble, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still a couch. If you order a package like this one over here that includes that parts that you need and directs the assembly of a functioning firearm, you bought a gun,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he declared, striding over to the kit and demonstrating the ease of constructing the weapon. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t take very long,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnyone can order it in the mail.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden also named Steve Dettelbach, a former US attorney from Ohio, as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s previous nominee was forced to withdraw amid opposition in the Senate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis mission of this agency isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t controversial \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s public safety,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said. What you should know about ghost guns, ahead of Biden's expected announcement on new regulations The moves came as gun violence and crime have ticked up in the United States, putting pressure on the White House to take action. A rash of shootings over the weekend underscored the emergency: Four people, including two teens, were shot shortly after a Major League Baseball game in Washington, DC, on Saturday night, police said. In Illinois, six people were found injured after a shooting occurred in a residential neighborhood. Police are also investigating a shooting at a birthday party in Indianapolis where six people were shot and one person was killed. And two people were also killed and 10 hospitalized after a \u201a\u00c4\u00fatargeted attack\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 at a Cedar Rapids nightclub, police say. Routine deadly gun violence is a uniquely American problem. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed gun violence a \u201a\u00c4\u00faserious public health threat\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 last year. Biden has made modest progress on gun control, but major steps like banning assault weapons or closing background check loopholes would require congressional action. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNone of this absolves Congress \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 for the responsibility to act,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said. Gun violence traditionally spikes in the summer months, lending further urgency to Monday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s actions. The new rule issued by the Justice Department seeks to rein in a type of weapon that has been seen more and more at crime scenes across the country. Ghost gun kits can be purchased online, and a weapon can be self-manufactured in as little as 30 minutes. Because regulators cannot trace them, ghost guns are appealing to criminals and those with criminal histories, according to officials. The new rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check, as is required for other types of firearm purchases. It also requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number, so the eventual weapon produced can be traced. And it mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to already built ghost guns they come across in their businesses. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAll of a sudden, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no longer a ghost,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said of the new rules. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt has a return address. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to help save lives, reduce crime and get more criminals off the streets.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faGhost guns look like a gun, they shoot like a gun, and they kill like a gun, but up until now they haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been regulated like a gun,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement celebrating the Biden administration for \u201a\u00c4\u00fadoubling down on its commitment to gun safety.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Mia Tretta, who was shot and wounded with a ghost gun in a school shooting in California in 2019, similarly praised the administration for taking \u201a\u00c4\u00faa critical step\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the new regulation. Tretta introduced the President in the Rose Garden on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you can put together an IKEA dresser, you can build a ghost gun,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said in a statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUnfortunately, it is that easy to get a weapon that has not only changed my life but has done the same thing to thousands of others. Finalizing this rule is a critical step to making sure no one else has to go through what my family has had to go through.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Justice Department previously launched a national ghost gun enforcement initiative, which will \u201a\u00c4\u00fatrain a national cadre of prosecutors and disseminate investigation and prosecution tools to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the White House. Biden said Monday that those who commit a crime using a ghost gun should \u201a\u00c4\u00faexpect federal prosecution.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis rule is an important step. It is going to make a difference, I promise you,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Biden said. Ghost guns have been used in multiple recent shootings, including at a Maryland high school in January. The exact number in circulation is unknowable, given the inability of regulators to track them. Between 2016 and 2021, the ATF received 45,000 reports of privately made firearms recovered by law enforcement, including 692 from homicides or attempted homicides. The agency was able to trace only 1% of them, officials said, because the firearms lack serial numbers. Maryland joins 10 states and DC becoming latest to place restrictions on ghost guns Multiple states have moved to restrict their sale as ghost guns become more common at crime scenes. Last week, Maryland joined Washington, DC, and 10 other states \u201a\u00c4\u00ec California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in banning or restricting the purchase or use of ghost guns, which are often bought online and assembled at home. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer again decried the use of ghost guns during a press conference Sunday, calling for a crackdown on the rise of the privately made firearms and speaking about a deadly shooting in the Bronx Friday. The New York Democrat blamed Republicans for holding up gun reform legislation, while pressing Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration to go further. \u201a\u00c4\u00faToday I am calling on the administration to go all after ghost guns, by putting out regulations that will stop them. The federal government has the ability through regulation to stop these ghost guns,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. Still, Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s planned firearm regulation drew backlash from gun rights advocates even before being officially announced. Aidan Johnston, the director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, said in a statement Sunday, \u201a\u00c4\u00faBiden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposal to create a comprehensive national gun registry and end the online sale of gun parts without the passage of a new law exemplifies his disregard for the Second Amendment.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In September, Biden withdrew his nomination of David Chipman to lead the ATF after facing opposition from Republicans and certain moderate Democrats. Chipman, a former career official at ATF, came under scrutiny from gun rights supporters and the National Rifle Association for his work as a senior adviser to Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the organization started by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at an event in her Arizona district in 2011. Dettelbach ran unsuccessfully for Ohio attorney general in 2018 after serving as US attorney in the state. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will be working hard to ensure that Steve Dettelbach receives the fair hearing and confirmation that he deserves. He should be a noncontroversial candidate because he has a long record of working in law enforcement and for the public safety of the people of Ohio and the American people,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 one of the officials said.

Anytime it does something that I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t feel is safe, I will take control of the car,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he says. But the reassurances haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t eased his wife\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerns. She says the technology is often jarring and anxiety-inducing. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m reading, that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s when I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Oh good grief,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sadie Krueger told CNN Business. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt would be jerky or swerve just out of the blue. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Whoa, are you drunk?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Krueger says she loves their Tesla Model 3, but she feels that \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 drives closer to large trucks than most drivers, and sometimes steers into the wrong lane. The technology drives like a \u201a\u00c4\u00fagrandpa\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in some cases, irritating nearby drivers, she says, but other times can be aggressive. Tesla enthusiasts with the unfinished, test version of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 currently a driver-assist system akin to an enhanced cruise control, are finding that family and friends like Krueger don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always share their enthusiasm. The technology promises to one day drive passengers to their destinations without human intervention. Many tell CNN Business that they use the software less when driving with other people, including their romantic partners. Passengers sometimes object to what they describe as the jerky driving style of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and have asked the Tesla fans not to use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in the vehicle. Some Tesla owners are preemptively deciding to not turn on \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 so that passengers get a smoother ride. Krueger said she humors her husband, as he gets a kick out of testing the software near their California home. His YouTube channel has more than 42,000 subscribers who watch his videos on Tesla. But she draws a line, too, and has asked him not to use it when she rides with him in cities or where he knows it is likely to be jerky. But plenty of passengers, especially younger ones like Krueger\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s teenage son, and tech junkies, are excited by the nascent technology, and savor the experience, flaws and all. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s said that lives will be transformed with safer roads and affordable transportation. Musk has described Teslas as \u201a\u00c4\u00faappreciating assets\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that should be worth as much as $200,000, and claims they could someday bring in up to $30,000 in gross profit as robotaxis in the automaker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposed future ridehail network. In Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pitch, robotaxis would operate like Uber or Lyft vehicles that could be summoned via a Tesla smartphone app. There would be no human driver behind the wheel. There might not even be a steering wheel or pedals in the vehicle. Some Tesla enthusiasts have purchased their vehicles with plans to use them as robotaxis in the future. But before Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s technology can change the world, it will first have to work, and then it will have to win over fans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 loved ones. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the reactions of family and friends of its beta testers. Tesla first released an early version of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to a small group in October 2021. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t really \u201a\u00c4\u00faself-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the eyes of regulators and autonomous vehicle experts. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s more like an enhanced cruise control that steers, accelerates and navigates intersections, but it needs an attentive human driver behind the wheel who can take control at any moment because of the system\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shortcomings. Drivers reported being both amazed and alarmed by the system, which sometimes shines, and in other cases makes seemingly dangerous decisions. Tesla owner Justin Demaree says he tries to use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as much as possible. He views it as historically significant work. Tesla cars with \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 send driving data back to the automaker, which uses it to refine the software. Demaree imagines a day when people may not even fly anymore because self-driving software gets so good. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt will change everything,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Demaree said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to pay attention, you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to do anything, you can spend that time with family or doing other things that are more productive or add more value.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But Demaree must reckon with the difference between the promised future and the current reality when his family gets in the car. He only uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 about half the time that he drives with his wife Heather. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s being temperamental, she doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to ask anymore,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Demarre said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just turn it off.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Walt Corey, 70, hopes he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll never have to turn off the \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 software while driving alone or with his wife, Nancy. He bought a Tesla in hopes of ensuring their mobility and independence as they age. He says she gets annoyed with the loud alarm that sounds to alert drivers when they need to immediately take control of the car because it can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t handle a situation. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really obnoxious,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Corey said, explaining that the noise bothers him as well. \u201a\u00c4\u00faLet me know if I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m about to drive off the cliff or hit somebody, but don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do it because the software gets confused.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Jeff Goin, a pilot and self-described \u201a\u00c4\u00fatechno-geek,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 bought a Tesla in part because he felt that Autopilot, its driver-assist technology that is more rudimentary than \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 would make him feel less fatigued after long drives. Tesla owners generally say that using Autopilot\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s auto-steering function on divided highways leaves them less drained after hours on the road. But Goin doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t use \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He tried the software and felt he was having to pay even more attention when using it. Goin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s partner Tim uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 regularly. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHang on,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin says he jokes to friends riding with them when Tim turns on \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 When the couple rides by themselves, Tim uses \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 less. Goin said he sometimes works in the car, so he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t like the distraction of being jostled. Even so, Goin says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s at times impressed with \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faSometimes you get in there and you think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s come a long way. And then it stops on the railroad tracks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin said, describing a recent incident in which he says his Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fafull self-driving\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 sensed a stop sign down the road and chose to stop earlier than advisable, briefly stopping on railroad tracks. Goin, who said he \u201a\u00c4\u00faimmensely\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 admires CEO Elon Musk, is skeptical of how soon self-driving vehicles will be a reality. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time on the regular scale, minutes on a regular scale and then there are Musk minutes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Goin said. Though Musk has never wavered in his promise that self-driving Teslas are just around the corner, the challenge of building a fully autonomous vehicle has proven harder than those developing them expected. Building a robotaxi that drives safely isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t enough, either. Robotaxis will have to operate smoothly enough to make passengers like Goin comfortable. Many of them are unlikely to accept as many flaws as early adopters of technology. John Gibbs, a Georgia professor who says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s long tested beta software, is \u201a\u00c4\u00faused to seeing things break and behave weirdly and you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Oh wow, I wonder what caused that,?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut there are people whose personality types are much less that.

State Judge Arthur Engoron in February had ordered Trump to \u201a\u00c4\u00facomply in full\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s subpoena seeking documents and information. Engoron also ruled that Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump should comply with the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s subpoenas for testimony, but the Trumps are appealing that decision. Justice Department investigating handling of White House records taken to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left office Friday afternoon, Engoron said Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorneys must appear in court on April 25 to defend against the contempt request. In a motion filed Thursday, the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office said that that Trump \u201a\u00c4\u00fadid not comply at all\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the subpoena for documents and that his attorneys said he would not produce \u201a\u00c4\u00faany\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 documents in response to the subpoena because his attorneys believe that if the documents exist, the Trump Organization would have them and the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office \u201a\u00c4\u00fawill just have to wait until the Trump Organization completes its production to get them.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 According to new filings, her office had agreed to extend an early March deadline for the documents until March 31. But rather than produce the documents that day, Trump presented 16 objections to the subpoena\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s demands. Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorneys also presented the attorney general\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office an affidavit from a Trump lawyer claiming that the former President was unable to locate the documents being and to the extent the documents existed, they were in the custody of Trump Organization, which faces a separate subpoena deadline. James argued on Thursday that Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorneys\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 response amounted to  \u201a\u00c4\u00famore delay and obfuscation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 saying that his objections came too late. She said that Trump was \u201a\u00c4\u00fahighly likely to have been in possession, custody or control of numerous documents\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 bearing on her investigation and that he failed to adequately detail the efforts he undertook to search for the subpoenaed documents. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMr. Trump should now be held in civil contempt and fined in an amount sufficient to coerce his compliance with the Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s order and compensate OAG for its fees and costs associated with this motion,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the filing stated. James is asking the court to impose a fine of $10,000 per day, or any other amount the court deems \u201a\u00c4\u00fasufficient to coerce his compliance with the Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s February 2022 Order,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as well as compensation for the attorney general offices costs and fees in filing the motion. Investigation into Trump Org. is ongoing despite resignations of top prosecutors, NY district attorney says An attorney for Trump said in a statement Thursday that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe are prepared to adamantly oppose the frivolous and baseless motion filed by the Attorney General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office today.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur client has consistently complied with the many discovery requests served by the Attorney General\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office over the years,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the attorney, Alina Habba, said. James previously said her office found multiple misleading or fraudulent misstatements and omissions in the Trump Organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial statements, which were provided to lenders and insurers, among others, as part of its investigation. In addition to the civil investigation James has launched, the Trump Organization also faces a criminal investigation being led by the Manhattan district attorney. Public turmoil has surrounded District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s probe, which he inherited from his predecessor, Cyrus Vance, after the high-profile departure of two senior prosecutors.

Morad Tahbaz, 66, who also has Iranian citizenship, has been confined to a hotel, the Foreign Office has said. His sister Taraneh told the BBC his family was \"absolutely distraught\" and feared he would be forgotten about. The Foreign Office says it is continuing to lobby Iran at the highest levels for Mr Tahbaz to be released. Hopes had been raised that Mr Tahbaz would be freed when Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released and flew back to the UK on Thursday, but he was returned to Evin prison on Friday. The Foreign Office said it had been informed by the Iranians this move was in order for Mr Tahbaz to have an electronic ankle bracelet fitted. On Sunday, the Foreign Office said he had been moved to a hotel in Tehran. Appearing alongside Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe at a news conference on Monday, Mr Tahbaz's daughter, Roxanne, said the family had been led to believe her father would be released with the other dual nationals. \"From the outset, we were always assured by the [UK government] that my father would be included in any deal that was made to release all of the hostages. \"So we're truly devastated, knowing now that this was not the case.\" Roxanne Tahbaz said the family \"just want them [the UK government] to do whatever they have to do\" to bring her father and mother, who is also subject to a travel ban inside Iran, back home. Speaking on the Today programme earlier, Taraneh Tahbaz said Mr Tahbaz had gone on hunger strike. \"He continues to be used as a pawn on a chessboard and it's very distressing,\" she said. \" We're agonised and we're absolutely distraught and we don't know what the next moves are.\" Mr Tahbaz was doing conservation work when he was held in Iran in January 2018. He and seven other conservationists were accused of collecting classified information about Iran's strategic areas under the pretext of carrying out environmental and scientific projects. The conservationists - members of Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation - had been using cameras to track endangered species including the Asiatic cheetah and Persian leopard, according to Amnesty International. All eight denied the charges and Amnesty International said there was evidence that they had been subjected to torture in order to extract forced \"confessions\". He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with his colleagues on vague charges of spying for the US and undermining Iran's security.

US President Joe Biden said the move targeted \"the main artery of Russia's economy\". Energy exports are a vital source of revenue for Russia but the move is also likely to impact Western consumers. Major brands have meanwhile continued to pull out of Russia, with McDonald's and Coca-Cola the latest to leave. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on energy. It is the world's third-biggest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia and the US. Before the measures were announced, Russia warned of \"catastrophic\" consequences for the global economy and said it might close its main gas pipeline to Germany. On the ground in Ukraine, civilians have been evacuated from two under-attack areas while the US has said up to 4,000 Russian troops may have been killed in the conflict. The conflict has already sent petrol prices to record highs in the US and the UK and experts warn they could go even higher. However, Venezuela could increase its oil production to help replace Russian oil. Reinaldo Quintero, president of the association that represents Venezuelan oil companies told the BBC that the country could potentially raise its production levels by 400,000 barrels a day. \"I think we can reach 1.2 million barrels per day with the infrastructure we have right now at this moment. So that will make us able to supply the need, some of the need, to the North American market,\" he said. President Biden's announcement followed pressure from both sides of the US political divide to do more to target the Russian economy. \"We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,\" he said. \"That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to [President Vladimir] Putin.\" Mr Biden admitted the move was \"not without cost at home,\" adding the decision was taken \"in close consultation\" with allies. In a similar move, the UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, accepted that the move would not hit Russia immediately but added \"what it will do is add to the pressure we're already seeing on Russia and don't forget that the economic impact of the sanctions that the UK has led has been extreme\". About 8% of US oil and refined product imports come from Russia, while Russia makes up about 6% of the UK's oil imports. By contrast, the EU is much more reliant on Russian energy, so the bloc's response stopped short of a ban. The European Commission said it would switch to alternative supplies and expand clean energy faster to fill the shortfall, with the aim of making Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels \"well before 2030\". This video can not be played Watch: Five times Russians have stood up for Ukraine \"We're not standing here to say this is going to be in any way easy,\" said the European Commission's Vice-President Frans Timmermans. \"But I am also deeply convinced that even if it's not easy, even if it's very hard, it's something we need to do, because now it's also intimately linked to our security.\" Russia later announced plans to ban the exports of certain commodities and raw materials. The details are still to be worked out, but Russia is a major exporter of grain and metals. Even countries with low Russian energy imports are set to feel the impact as the measures are likely to boost already high wholesale prices. Inflation is soaring in the US, EU and the UK, adding to the pressure on households. The move adds to a long list of economic sanctions imposed against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine - the central bank has had its assets frozen, some Russian banks have been cut off from global payment networks and Germany suspended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have transported more gas from Russia to Germany. But energy sales have continued to provide a source of cash despite the other financial restrictions. Russia says it may cut gas supplies if oil blocked How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

It even has control of time itself - or, at least, over the time that is displayed on the nation's clocks. Since World War One, the US - like many nations around the world - has set its clocks forward during summer hours in order to have more daylight in the afternoon (and, theoretically, conserve electricity), then rolled them back in autumn. On Tuesday, the US Senate voted to do away with that switch, making Daylight Savings Time - the summer month clock settings - permanent year-round. The legislation, called the Sunshine Protection Act, is the pet project of Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida (whose nickname, perhaps not coincidentally, is \"the Sunshine State\"). He has been pitching legislation to make Daylight Savings Time permanent for four years, but this is the first time he's found some success. The Senate measure was approved by unanimous consent - a process usually reserved for non-controversial legislation like naming post offices, designating disease-awareness days and celebrating sports league champions - just a few days after the US implemented its annual \"spring forward\" time change. \"Pardon the pun,\" Mr Rubio said after the bill was approved, \"but this is an idea whose time has come.\" During his floor speech, the Florida senator presented a number of arguments in favour of the change. He said there are studies showing that clock-switching has a deleterious effect on health. Heart attacks and accident rates increase around the time changes. And anything that gives children more daylight to play in after school ends, instead of sitting inside, in front of electronics, is a good thing in his mind. (Florida is a state where children might still want to play outside in January, of course.) Education is a concern for opponents of the legislation, however, who note that more children will end up going to school in the dark - which could be dangerous - under the new system. Any one senator could have objected and prevented passage of Mr Rubio's proposal, but the speed at which it came up for consideration may have caught opponents off-guard. According to Buzzfeed News, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton would have blocked the bill but his staff didn't inform him the legislation was being brought to the floor. Confusion seemed to be the order of the day for all but a handful of the Senate's daylight time enthusiasts. \"It's literally an issue my staff and I had never discussed, and they made an assumption that I don't really care about daylight saving time,\" Delaware Senator Chris Coons told Buzzfeed. \"And I don't know if I do! I've never taken five minutes to stop and think about it.\" It's too late for that now, at least in the Senate. The legislation moves to the House of Representatives, where it must also be approved by majority vote before it can be signed into law by President Joe Biden. The White House hasn't taken a position on the matter, but House Speaker Nany Pelosi, after expressing  her own surprise that the Senate had acted so quickly, said she supported the measure - although she added that her chamber was more focused on tasks related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Assistant US Attorney Veronica Alegria argued against Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s release, claiming Papini is an \u201a\u00c4\u00faextreme flight risk\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and has a \u201a\u00c4\u00falengthy pattern of dishonesty.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s alleged fraudulent disappearance was not without consequences to others: It cost upward of $230,000 and \u201a\u00c4\u00facountless hours\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of manpower, according to officials. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUltimately, the investigation revealed that there was no kidnapping,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 US Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said in the DOJ news release, \u201a\u00c4\u00faand that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted based on the defendant\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conduct.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN has reached out multiples times to Michael Borges, an attorney for Papini, for comment. During Tuesday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s virtual court appearance, Borges said his client has no intention to flee while she awaits trial. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s husband reported her missing November 2, 2016, after she failed to pick up her kids at day care. She was found three weeks later, alone on Interstate 5 about 140 miles from home. She told police she had been kidnapped by two women who wore masks and spoke Spanish. They held her at gunpoint, she said, kept her chained in a closet and branded her. But last week, the Justice Department said Papini was actually with an ex-boyfriend in Southern California and that she caused her own injuries in support of her abduction claim. In all, the cost of the investigation borne by public safety agencies was around $150,000 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a conservative estimate, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said in a statement on Facebook last week. But the cost isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t only measured in dollars, Johnson said. Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case and her story diverted resources from real cases with real victims. Years ago, she told police she had been abducted, beaten and branded. Now she's charged with making it all up \u201a\u00c4\u00faNot only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the sheriff said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faFinally,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faall of law enforcement in Shasta (County) was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling (of) this case.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case cost the public in other ways, too. According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, between 2017 and 2021, Papini received $30,000 from the California Victim Compensation Board, which assists and reimburses victims of violent crimes for \u201a\u00c4\u00facrime-related expenses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 they suffer. In Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s case, the affidavit says, $1,000 was used so Papini could buy blinds for her home and nearly $2,000 were paid to the ambulance provider who transported Papini after she was found. The rest of the money were payments for Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s therapy and treatment for anxiety and post-traumatic stress stemming from her supposed kidnapping. Then, there was the GoFundMe campaign that allegedly netted just over $49,000. Per the affidavit, donors were told the funds would be used to \u201a\u00c4\u00fafind and bring Sherri home.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 In fact, federal prosecutors say, more than $30,000 was withdrawn by a family member from the campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bank account and more than $11,000 was used to pay off the family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s personal credit cards. The remaining amount was \u201a\u00c4\u00faspent on personal expenses,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the affidavit says. A GoFundMe spokesperson told CNN the fundraiser has been removed from the platform and has not been actively receiving donations since 2016. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are working with law enforcement to assist with their ongoing investigation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the spokesperson said. Regarding the GoFundMe campaign, family spokesman Chris Thomas referred questions to Borges, the attorney for Papini. Last week, Thomas criticized Papini\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s arrest, which the spokesperson said happened in front of her children. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf requested, Sherri would have fully complied and come to the police station,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faas she has done multiple times before, where this could have been handled in a more appropriate way.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Papini and her husband \u201a\u00c4\u00facooperated\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with law enforcement, Thomas said, adding, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are confused by several aspects of the charges and hope to get clarification in the coming days.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 CNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Taylor Romine contributed to this report.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

FIRST ON FOX: A violent career criminal allegedly slashed a stranger in the face on the subway Sunday after he was released without bail for a similar attack on a woman in Brooklyn, Fox News Digital has learned. Brendan Dowling, 40, allegedly walked up to a 41-year-old man sitting on the J train and sliced open his face at about 8:30 a.m. March 6, as the subway car neared the Lower East Side station. NYC SUBWAY ATTACKS: MAN SHOT, WOMAN SEXUALLY ABUSED, AS POLICE HUNT SUSPECT WHO ASSAULTED VICTIM WITH HUMAN FECES It was Dowling's sixth arrest since he was released without bail in October after pleading guilty to attempted assault for slashing a woman in the head in Dec. 2020 in downtown Brooklyn, according to police and prosecutors. It wasn't immediately clear why he was sprung from jail on the Brooklyn case, but he faces a mandatory minimum of 3 \u00bd years in prison when he's sentenced, court records show. At Dowling's arraignment Monday in Manhattan criminal court, he was ordered held on $50,000 cash over $100,000 bond on charges of first-degree attempted assault and second-degree assault. Manhattan prosecutors said they were probing whether the slashing was motivated by anti-Asian bias. It was the latest in a string of vicious assaults on straphangers.

He is accused of plunging a knife into the back of a 77-year-old woman at about 8:10 a.m. March 1 in Cypress Hills Brooklyn in an unprovoked attack. Last month, he allegedly punched a 20-year-old woman in the head then stabbed her repeatedly in the stomach at a different Brooklyn subway station. NYC MAN CHARGED IN SUBWAY HAMMER ATTACK HAS RAP SHEET DATING BACK DECADES Last weekend at least seven straphangers were assaulted, including a man who narrowly escaped an assailant swinging an ax, according to the New York Post. The spike in subway violence comes after Mayor Eric Adams launched a program on Feb. 21 to remove the mentally ill and homeless from the transit system and connect them with services.

The bill would criminalise performing an abortion in almost all cases, except where it could \"save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency\". Medical professionals convicted under the laws face fines of up to $100,000 (\u00a376,505) and 10 years in prison. It comes as the US Supreme Court weighs a case that could overturn abortion rights across the US later this year. Oklahoma's House of Representatives, in which Republicans hold a supermajority, voted to send the bill to the governor's office by 70 votes to 14. The state's Governor Kevin Stitt will be presented with the bill for his approval. The Republican has already committed to signing into law any legislation that restricts abortion rights. Republican Rep Jim Olsen, who authored the bill, said he was \"thrilled\" by its passage and said the legislation could see \"many lives of babies saved\". But pro-choice groups say the bill is a devastating blow for women, noting it comes after the state became a major destination for women from neighbouring Texas seeking abortions after the passage of extremely restrictive laws in the state last year. \"Nearly half of the patients Oklahoma providers are currently seeing are medical refugees from Texas,\" a coalition of pro-choice groups said. \"Now, Oklahomans could face a future where they would have no place left in their state to go to seek this basic health care.\" Tamya Cox-Toure, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, said in a statement the bill serves as an \"alarming reminder that the days of access to safe and legal abortion may be numbered, and we must continue to fight to guarantee all people have access to the essential health care they need, including abortion\". Republican dominated legislatures have been passing a series of restrictive abortion measures in recent years, designed to set up a showdown in the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. The court is due to rule by the end of June on a case involving a Republican-backed Mississippi law which could see conservative justices overturn the Roe v Wade decision that legalised abortion under federal law in 1973. The ruling could cut off abortion services for tens of millions of women and likely see similar laws bar abortion in nearly two dozen states. By Angelica Casas, BBC News, Texas The latest tactic in anti-abortion legislation is to target and punish providers. When Texas last year passed the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, some abortion providers I spoke to shut their services altogether, fearing reprimand. People seeking abortions were forced to find alternative options, like accessing abortion pills and travelling out of state. Nearly half of Texans who left the state went to Oklahoma. That may no longer be an option once this law goes into effect there later this year. \"Legislation like SB 612 on its face is very chilling to people's willingness to practise in states that are this hostile to providers,\" says Zachary Gingrich-Gaylord of Trust Women, one of four abortion clinics in Oklahoma. \"That's the point.\" Supporters of the law, like State Senator Nathan Dahm, have boasted that the measure is now the \"strongest pro-life legislation in the country\". And they point out the law does not penalise women but the providers. Trust Women has long depended on medical professionals from out of state to perform abortions because, they say, it's difficult to find local providers willing to go public about where they work. \"It makes it difficult to bring on even support staff in the clinic at a time that we're seeing an increased volume of patients,\" says Gingrich-Gaylord told me. It is a victory for anti-abortion groups who say their priority is to protect the unborn.

The country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first woman justice, nominated by President Ronald Reagan, made deft use of the forum to introduce herself to the nation and eventually to win confirmation by a 99-0 vote. Since then, audiences have seen other historic moments, dramatic flashpoints and instances of levity. As the Senate begins its hearings for President Joe Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who would be the first Black woman justice, here are 10 of the many episodes that have stood out over the past four decades. She emphasized at the outset her experience as a state court judge in Arizona and her devotion to family. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBy way of preamble,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said as she began introducing her family, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI would note that \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I have performed some marriage ceremonies in my capacity as judge.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She then read from the form she used describing marriage as \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe foundation of the family, mankind\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s basic unit of society, the hope of the world and strength of the country.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Connor was a former state senator and experienced politician who nimbly handled queries about the law and her life. The Senate confirmed her without any dissent. This nominee of Reagan with a deeply conservative record faced a Democratic Senate, and in particular, Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy set much of the tone when he dramatically claimed of the then-President\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s plan to elevate the US appellate court judge: \u201a\u00c4\u00faRobert Bork\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, Blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 doors in midnight raids.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 At the hearings, Bork\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s right-wing ideology, rather than his intelligence and experience, remained the focus. When asked why he wanted to be a justice, he memorably stressed the \u201a\u00c4\u00faintellectual feast\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of it all: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI have spent my life in the intellectual pursuits in the law. And since I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been a judge, I particularly like the courtroom.

He was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to succeed the first Black justice, Thurgood Marshall, who was retiring. Thomas, also African American, underwent two sets of hearings, the first devoted to his substantive record, the second following the sexual harassment accusations of law professor Anita Hill, a former Thomas employee. He categorically denied the charges, declaring to the committee, chaired by then-Sen. Joe Biden, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is a circus. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a national disgrace. And from my standpoint as a Black American, as far as I am concerned, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate confirmed him 52-48, which at that point was the closest Supreme Court confirmation vote in more than a century. President George W. Bush nominated him to be chief justice upon the death of William Rehnquist, and Roberts\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 balls-and-strikes metaphor continues to be evoked by judicial candidates today: \u201a\u00c4\u00faJudges are like umpires,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Roberts told senators. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUmpires don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t make the rules, they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Roberts was confirmed for chief justice by a 78-22 vote. Biden remained an active Senate Judiciary Committee questioner even after he passed on the committee chairmanship, and he brought in a prop for an exchange with Alito. The then-senator was exploring the nominee\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s connection to a Princeton alumni group reputed to oppose the admission of women and minorities. Biden first referred to Alito\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Italian-American background and his own Irish Catholic roots. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI read your opening statement again, where you said that, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2A generation earlier I think that somebody from my background probably would not have felt fully comfortable at a college like Princeton.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s how I felt,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Biden, who went to the University of Delaware for college. Biden then produced a Princeton cap and put it on. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI can wear this hat proudly today,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said, because the university improved its record of women and minority admissions. Alito told senators he could not recall participating in the controversial group. The Senate confirmed him 58-42. The child of Puerto Rican parents was nominated by President Barack Obama as the first Hispanic justice. She drew some controversy for a remark she often made as she spoke to women\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legal groups, that \u201a\u00c4\u00faI would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t lived that life.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Some Republicans contended the comment was racist and it began to take on a life of its own. At her hearings, Sotomayor said she wanted to make clear that she was simply trying to inspire Latinas to believe that their life experiences would enrich the legal system. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI want to state upfront and unequivocally and without doubt, I do not believe any ethnic, racial, or gender group has an advantage in sound judging.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She was confirmed 68-31. Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second nominee produced one of the lighter memorable exchanges as she was questioned by Sen. Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina Republican began asking her about a failed al Qaeda bomb plot on Christmas Day in 2009. Kagan was wary about where he was heading with his questioning about the man apprehended. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Graham said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just asked you where you were on Christmas.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 She rejoined, \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou know, like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Appreciating the levity, Graham said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faGreat answer.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate approved Kagan 63-37. President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first choice for the high court had a record from more than a decade as a US appellate court judge based in Denver, but one case was particularly targeted. It involved a trucker whose rig had broken down in sub-zero temperatures and who, against company rules, unhitched it and drove away to warm up awhile. When the case came before him, Gorsuch interpreted federal law to say the trucker who was fired was not covered by the usual statutory labor protections. Then-Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, drilled down on the case, identifying with the trucker and describing his plight as \u201a\u00c4\u00faabsurd.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Gorsuch said his decision was limited by his interpretation of the law at issue. When pressed by Franken about what he would have done if he had been a trucker, the judge said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faOh, Senator, I do not know what I would have done if I were in his shoes, and I do not blame him at all for a moment for doing what he did. I empathize with him entirely.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate confirmed Gorsuch 54-45. This Trump nominee, like Thomas, had two sets of hearings, the second prompted by a sexual assault claim raised by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, dating to their teenage years living in the Washington, DC, suburbs. Kavanaugh categorically denied the claim and told the committee, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades. This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country. And as we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around. I am an optimistic guy, I always try to be on the sunrise side of the mountain, to be optimistic about the day that is coming, but today I have to say that I fear for the future.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The Senate confirmed him 50-48. Graham chaired the Judiciary Committee hearings for Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s third nominee and declared at the outset, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is the first time in American history that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve nominated a woman who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Barrett, a former Notre Dame law professor, had been vocal regarding her Catholic faith and opposition to abortion rights. In her own testimony, Barrett said she had \u201a\u00c4\u00fano agenda\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 regarding the reversal of the Supreme Court\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s abortion rights precedent dating to the 1973 Roe v. Wade. Barrett testified without notes and, at the urging of Sen. John Cornyn, held up the blank notepad that was on the desk before her. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s impressive,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Texas Republican said.

A New Jersey man has been sentenced to 375 years in jail in the 2016 killing of three people, including two children, and attempted murder of three more after authorities say he became enraged over a Facebook post.

That's a good thing for the rest of the world. The country that began this century by invading not one but two countries, has become more modest in the face of the nightmare that is Ukraine. Forget shock and awe, this is the era of caution and apprehension. That's what having no good options will do for you. Friday's two-hour phone call with China's President Xi, superpower to superpower, was a sign of how hard it will be for America to stop this war. The US's leverage over China is limited, and readouts from both sides suggest the call didn't achieve much. But it was part of an orchestrated diplomatic strategy that contrasts with much of the first year of Joe Biden's presidency. After the fiasco of the Afghan withdrawal last summer, America lost credibility with its European allies. US intelligence looked unprepared, and the operation of leaving was staggeringly incompetent. What's more, European diplomats complained, America didn't really consult with allies. America pulled out on its own precipitous timetable, leaving countries that still had forces and personnel in the country scrambling. When some Europeans said it would be smart to leave a residual Nato force, the White House ignored the pleas. That heavy-handed mission was followed by another. In September, the White House announced a nuclear submarine security pact between Australia, Britain and the US. The pact left the French, who had been negotiating their own sub sale to the Australians, out in the cold. Worse, the Elysee Palace said it learned of the new deal from the press. It was a masterclass in how not to handle your oldest ally. The French were so furious that President Biden apologised and admitted the US had been clumsy. But the damage was done. By the autumn of 2021 Europeans were disappointed in the Biden administration and felt their hopes that a post-Trump America would be more collegial were ill-founded. When Washington started ringing the alarm bell about Russia and Ukraine, Europeans weren't in much mood to listen. \"War-mongering\" was how one EU diplomat described it to me. Whether it was the lesson of Afghanistan or the nature of this particularly difficult catastrophe, we don't know, but the White House handled this crisis very differently. From the start it has consulted with its allies, many of whom were sceptical. There are reports that US diplomats approached Europeans as equals not subordinates. The administration shared highly secret intelligence in a manner that was unprecedented. In the months that led up to the invasion senior White House officials made multiple trips to meet their European counterparts. President Biden made regular phone calls to European leaders. This wasn't Iraq in 2002, it wasn't Trump's America First, it wasn't Afghanistan in 2021. This was genuine alliance building. On 27 January there was an indication that the shuttle diplomacy was bearing fruit. A full month before the invasion, during an otherwise ordinary press briefing, the White House spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, announced that German Chancellor Olaf Sholz would visit the White House on 7 February. Securing that visit of the brand new German leader was an indication that the administration both anticipated what was coming, and knew what was needed: German co-operation. A visit to the White House is a coup for any foreign leader, it's a useful weapon of soft power. Yes, President Zelensky's articulate appeals also played a big part in shifting German policy, but US diplomacy helped win German support. Beyond diplomacy, there is a new recognition here of Washington's military limits, a realisation that force won't get America everything it wants, however strong its army. That's an unusual position for the world's biggest military. When Saddam Hussein marched into Kuwait in 1990, the US rallied the world to put boots on the ground to get him out. In 1999 President Clinton ordered Nato jets to conduct airstrikes in Kosovo. After 9/11, the US strong-armed a coalition of the unwilling to invade Iraq. In 2011, the US military was part of the operation that helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. Today Washington is holding back, resisting the emotional pleas of Zelensky to use that military clout. It's sending weapons, intelligence and cyber-support. But for the moment it won't do more. America knows it could impose, and most probably enforce, a no-fly zone. It has the jets and missiles and pilots to do so. But, as the White House says repeatedly, mobilising the might of the Pentagon won't necessarily end this war, it might make it worse. The more America leads, the greater the risk that Putin can sell this to his own people as a fight between Russia and the US. Which is why you won't hear this White House talk about regime change, or democracy, or even freedom in Russia. I reread President Bush's second inaugural address, delivered in 2005, at the height of the Iraq war, when neo-conservatives ran US foreign policy. \"It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nature and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world,\" the newly re-elected president declared. Talk about hubris. Yet the White House also understands the risks of not being more assertive. It knows that not intervening could lead to the deaths of countless more Ukrainian civilians, and President Putin may strike a Nato country anyway. So it walks a tightrope with potentially horrifying consequences, recognising that there are no good answers. The US is left to help Ukrainians from the sidelines. And maybe that is all they can do. It is enough to make anyone more humble. What weapons has the US given Ukraine?

The Oxford indie group's song spent 59 weeks on its slow ascent to the summit of the Billboard Hot 100. The previous record was held by Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, on 35 weeks. \"I absolutely can't believe it,\" singer Dave Bayley said. \"For it to do this means the absolute world.\" He added in a Twitter message to fans: \"This song came out at the beginning of the pandemic and we didn't think it would really go anywhere because of that, and it has because you guys have embraced it so much.\" There are slow-burning hits, then there's Heat Waves - a song that took longer to reach room temperature than an ice age mammoth. The song's 59-week trek to the top of the US Billboard chart eclipses the previous record-holder, Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, by a massive 24 weeks. With just one song, Glass Animals have spent 27 more weeks on the chart than The Prodigy have managed in their entire career. The Oxford band also became the first UK group to break into Spotify's global top 10 since Clean Bandit in 2018 (Coldplay have since made the chart, too). The song had all the right ingredients for a sleeper hit. Glass Animals were well respected in the industry, with a Mercury Prize nomination for their second album How To Be A Human Being - but they weren't big enough to have their song automatically added to radio station and streaming service playlists. It took months for Heat Waves to cross over from alternative radio to pop stations, building up a bigger head of steam as it went. Streaming also played a crucial part in its success. Songs tend to have a longer half-life now than 10 years ago, as fans continue to play their favourite tracks, keeping them afloat for months on end. Glass Animals were also given a late boost by TikTok, where creator Juliette Cullen used Heat Waves to soundtrack a viral video about a lack of curly fries in certain branches of McDonald's. The band have joked its success is all down to Bayley's mum streaming it on a loop\u2026 but given that the song's been played 1.3 billion times on Spotify alone, she'd had to have started 9,900 years ago. In reality, it's just a great song - one whose vibey production and low-key hooks reveal new treasures on each listen. Hopefully its success will encourage people to seek out the rest of the band's equally-rewarding back catalogue. The song, which was originally released as a single in June 2020, first snuck into the US singles chart in 100th place in January 2021. Allow YouTube content?

Most weeks ever to reach US number one: Heat Waves peaked at number five in the UK in October 2021. Bayley, who wrote and produced the grower, told the BBC it had its genesis as far back as May 2018. \"We were winding down from touring our second album and I hired a studio in north London called The Church,\" he explained last year. \"I was in the little basement room, which used to be the kitchen - and I've recently found out that's where Bob Dylan used to sit and write. He only wanted to be in the kitchen, apparently. \"Anyway, I spent all day there\u2026 but I was fishing and catching rubbish.

Or maybe, when St Patrick's Day approaches, you'd think of the parade in New York or the Chicago River being dyed green. However, there is a city and a town that both lay claim to be America's most Irish and chances are you may not have heard of either. One is a former mining city in the north west and the other a town in the heart of America's \"Irish Riviera\". According to the 2010 census, the Massachusetts coastal town of Scituate is home to a higher concentration of people who trace their ancestry back to Ireland than any other town or city in the United States. Just under half of the town's population said they were of Irish heritage, although that figure dropped slightly in 2020. The figure in Plymouth County, in which the town is situated, stands at slightly more than 30% Irish-American. The South Shore of Massachusetts is an area stretching from south of Boston to Cape Cod, which has been affectionally referred to as the \"Irish Riviera\" for many years. Between 1820 and 1930, it is estimated that as many as 4.5m Irish people arrived in America. While large numbers of emigrants from Ulster in the 1700s settled in the Appalachian region and southern states, many of the newer emigrants settled in the north east. In the 1850s a Boston fisherman and Irish immigrant, Daniel Ward, found Irish moss, also known as carrageenan, growing beneath the rocks on Scituate's shores. It was not only a potential food source, but was also used as a thickening agent used in cosmetics, desserts, beer, paint, and more. This was the beginning of the Irish mossing industry on the South Shore. Later, with its proximity to Boston, Irish-American residents of that city holidayed, bought second homes and in many cases permanently relocated to Scituate and the surrounding towns on the South Shore. Siobh\u00e1n Hunter, of the Scituate Sister City West Cork Committee and whose father was originally from Belfast, says \"Irishness has been instilled in our everyday lives here\". \"It is a part of us,\" she adds. \"You'll see Irish surnames on businesses all around town and the South Shore, Irish flags hung all year round, painted Irish flags on pedestrian walks in Sand Hills, an annual Easter Rising Memorial and now permanent monument in our harbour.\" The town, which has a population of about 19,000 also, of course, pulls out all the stops for St Patrick's Day. \"We have a massive St Patrick's Day parade that attracts 15,000 to 20,000 people from all over,\" says Siobh\u00e1n. \"We tend to enjoy at least a week of celebrations and find that most everyone joins in on the spirit of St Patrick's Day, in one way or another. \"We are a country that is made up of generations of immigrants, from all over the globe. Therefore, it's not just about celebrating contributions of Irish, but all immigrants.\" Scituate has been \"sistered\" or \"twinned\" with the West Cork area of Ireland since 2016. \"We have a cultural exchange, which includes everything from delegations to marketing ideas, coastal flood management, environmental science, as well as student exchanges,\" Siobh\u00e1n says. \"From the Scituate West Cork Sister City Committee also spawned the idea of the South Shore Irish Heritage Trail, inspired by Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way. \"It is the hope to not only educate people that live in these areas as to the contributions and sacrifices of Irish and Irish-Americans, but also people from all over the world.\" While Scituate can claim the title of most Irish town in the US, Butte, Montana, has often been referred to as the most Irish city in the country. Around a quarter of Butte's population claim Irish heritage. but the influence of Irish culture on the former mining town's history is also important. Teresa Scott of the Montana Gaelic Cultural Society says the main reason so many Irish came to live in Butte is copper. \"Butte is a mining town and copper was king in the late 1800s and early 1900s,\" she says. \"Irish came to work the copper mines in Butte and the surrounding area.\" The Montana Gaelic Cultural Society sponsors language immersion weekends, the An Ri Ra Montana Irish Festival and gives grants to educational groups that promote Irish music, dance and heritage. \"We don't just represent the Irish, but all Celtic nations,\" Teresa says. Mike O'Connor of the Montana Ancient Order of Hibernians says in its time Butte has had more people per capita with Irish decent than any other city in the United States and still retains the sense of Irishness. He added that there are St Patrick's Day parades throughout Montana. \"Also at our state capitol in Helena we raise the Irish flag on St Patrick's Day. \"We have been doing this for 37 years. We are the only capitol in the United States to do this.\" Teresa describes St Patrick's Day, when the city's population of 35,000 people is swollen by thousands of visitors, as \"the high holy day in Butte\". \"It's celebrated on 17 March with a parade, dancing, music, food and drink,\" she says. \"In Butte you can walk around with your beverage in public and with spring break falling in the same week, it gets a bit rowdy in uptown Butte, especially if it's a sunny day with no wind or snow. \"There is a family friendly event in the evening called Handing Down the Heritage where we have local Irish dancers and bands, along with bagpipers. It's a grand time. \"Other cities have parades and Irish dancers and music, but Butte is where everyone wants to be.\" Like Scituate, she says other ethnic groups join in the St Patrick's Day celebrations. \"Butte is very ethnically diverse,\" Teresa says. \"Many different nationalities came to work in the mines and stayed - Italians, Finnish, Serbians, Chinese, Norwegian, Croatian, Greek, Lebanese, Welsh and Cornish. \"On 16 March Butte celebrates the Finnish St Urho Days. He chased the grasshoppers, some say frogs, out of Finland. \"It is the precursor for the St Patrick's Day celebration.\" So while there may be debate as to who can claim the title of America's most Irish town, what is certain is that after Covid restricted events last year, this year's St Patrick's Day events will be celebrated with even more gusto than usual.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is_not_biased"}]}

But Hudson Swafford could never have expected what happened to him at the Masters on Friday. Hitting his second on the historic par-five 13th hole, the US golfer lined up to hit his iron shot from the fairway. He swung, connected with the ball, and the ball flew in the correct direction. However, much to Swafford\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bemusement, the head of his club flew off the end of his club, leaving the bewildered golfer holding the shaft and handle of his club.

Three fox kits have also been put down after their mother was trapped and confirmed to have the disease. The fox attacks stirred up a frenzy on Capitol Hill, frequented by many politicians, as well as on Twitter. Officials are urging residents to report encounters with any aggressive, sick or injured foxes. Reports of an aggressive fox began on Monday. The next day, Capitol Police trapped the fox for testing and confirmed she had rabies, an infectious disease that affects the nervous systems and is passed on through bites and scratches from an infected animal. On Thursday, officials said her baby foxes had to also be euthanised since \"the kits could have been exposed [to rabies] during grooming or other means\". \"They were no longer able to be safely rehabilitated.\" One of the bite victims was California congressman Ami Bera, who was walking near one of the Senate office buildings on Monday when he felt something lunge at him, and which he first thought was a small dog. He told the Associated Press that he used his umbrella to try and fend off the fox during the encounter, which he estimated lasted about 15 seconds. Allow Twitter content?

She later tweeted: \"You're telling me I survived three years of a pandemic to be bit by a rabid fox.\" Both have started the first series of four rabies shots as a precaution. Officials are contacting everyone who had been bitten, though there are no plans to take action against healthy foxes. Foxes are not uncommon in DC and the National Park Service says the animals adapt well to both city and rural life. There are numerous fox dens on the National Mall, a downtown park that hosts many of the city's iconic monuments, but their location can change year to year.

President Joe Biden signed a bill into law on March 14 that awards a Congressional Gold Medal to the women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, nicknamed the \u201a\u00c4\u00faSix Triple Eight.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The honor was granted \u201a\u00c4\u00fain recognition of their pioneering military service, devotion to duty, and contributions to increase the morale of personnel stationed in the European theater of operations during World War II,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the bill states. The bipartisan bill, introduced by Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), was passed by the Senate in April 2021 and the House last month. The Six Triple Eight was a unit made up of about 850 Black women who were tasked with overcoming a massive backlog of mail, according to the Department of Defense. The unit traveled to Great Britain in 1945, surviving encounters with Nazi U-boats and a German rocket explosion along the way, before spending months sorting through mail and packages stacked to the ceiling in unheated warehouses, according to the US Army Center of Military history. They adopted the motto, \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo mail, low morale.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The unit set up a new mail tracking system and cleared the six-month backlog of mail in just three months, the center said. By the end of the war, the unit processed about 17 million pieces of mail, according to the National World War II Museum. Like much of the country, the military was segregated throughout World War II. Black service members faced continuous racism, and the women of the 6888th have sharp memories of being segregated on trains, spat at and demeaned by White men and women. The unit later was moved to France and then ultimately disbanded without fanfare in 1946. There were no commemorative ceremonies for members when they came home at the end of the war. The Six Triple Eight was led by Army Maj. Charity Earley (n\u221a\u00a9e Adams), who later rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. She died in 2002, and her son praised the belated recognition last year. These Black female soldiers brought order to chaos and delivered a blow against inequality \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wonderful, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Stanley Earley III. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt should have happened 50, 60 years ago. But there is now the opportunity for a recognition that these folks did all these things that were so important.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 As of last summer, only seven members were believed to still be alive, he said. The medal is part of a belated recognition of the unit\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s efforts in recent years. A monument honoring the battalion was dedicated in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 2018. A documentary, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Six Triple Eight: No Mail, Low Morale,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 celebrated the mail tracking system the battalion created. In a statement, Moran and Rosen praised the signing of the bill and the battalion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s war efforts. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe heroic, barrier-breaking members of the Six Triple Eight Battalion \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which included brave Nevada women \u201a\u00c4\u00ec played a crucial role in the operations of our armed forces during World War II,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Rosen said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThey deserve our nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highest honors for their service. There is no better time to give them this long-overdue recognition than during Women\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s History Month, and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m proud to see President Biden sign our bipartisan legislation into law.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe women of the Six Triple Eight have earned a special place in history for their service to our nation, and as of today, their sacrifice is enshrined into law with the highest distinction Congress can bestow,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Moran said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt has been an honor to meet members of the battalion and help lead this effort to award the Six Triple Eight with the Congressional Gold Medal \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the highest expression of national appreciation from Congress.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The White House has not yet set a schedule for when the award will be granted.

After two months in custody, the world is now paying more attention to her case. In one of the last public sightings of Brittney Griner, captured on CCTV, the American professional basketball player is seen walking through airport security trailing a small, black suitcase. Ms Griner, a star centre for the Phoenix Mercury, had landed at the Sheremetyevo airport, outside Moscow, in February. She was in Russia to play during the WNBA off-season. In the security footage, she wears running shoes, black sweatpants and a black hoodie with \"Black Lives for Peace\" written on the back, her dark hair hanging in locs down past her shoulders. At 6ft 9in - tall even by basketball standards - she towers above the customs agents and other travellers. In another shot, she is seen sitting in front of a man, seemingly a customs agent, shaking her head \"no\". Then, nothing - until a Russian mugshot emerged on state television. Ms Griner, 31, had been arrested by Russian authorities on drug charges. On 14 June, state-owned Russian outlet TASS reported that her pre-trial detention had been extended until 2 July. Citing unnamed sources, TASS has also reported that Russia hopes to trade Ms Griner for an arms trafficker serving a 25-year sentence in the US, Viktor Bout. Asked about this report, the US State Department said it \"would not comment on speculation\". \"What we will say is that using the practice of wrongful detention as a bargaining chip represents a threat to the safety of everyone travelling, working, and living abroad. The United States opposes this practice everywhere,\" a spokesman said. The uncertainty around her fate has fuelled an outpouring of support for the player. And it has also engendered a sense of outrage among some fans who say the response to Ms Griner's detainment was, at first, strangely muted. Following her arrest, fans and experts said that they felt the attention she was given in comparison to male players exposed longstanding gender inequities in professional sports. \"If this was an NBA [professional men's league] player of her calibre... this would be on the cover of not only every sports page but every news media page in the world,\" said Tamryn Spruill, a sports journalist who is writing a book on the WNBA and Ms Griner's contributions to the league. Ms Griner, a nine-year veteran of the league - is the \"best of the best\", said Melissa Isaacson, a sportswriter and professor at Northwestern University in the US state of Illinois. \"She's every bit the Tom Brady of her sport,\" Ms Isaacson said. \"You could argue very accurately that she is one of the best athletes in the world.\" A native of Houston, Texas, she earned a basketball scholarship to Baylor University where she led the team to a national championship. She is now one of the WNBA's most dominant players in history, widely considered the best offensive player in the league. Few have accomplished what Ms Griner has done - winning a college championship, WNBA and Euroleague titles and an Olympic gold medal. And, famously, her ability to dunk is unmatched. Off the court, she has also been seen as a trailblazer, coming out as gay at age 22, just around the time of her entry into professional sport. She then became the first overall draft pick in the WNBA that year and, soon after, the first openly gay athlete to be endorsed by Nike. \"Before Griner, there was this shadow over the league, where it was like 'don't say gay,'\" Ms Spruill said. \"And she was just like 'screw that, this is who I am'.\" \"BG's always been one to be a pioneer,\" Griner's teammate, Diana Taurasi has said. Despite all this, Ms Griner had a second job, and that was why she had flown to Russia - to play for EuroLeague team UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she had worked since 2014 during the US off-season. Roughly half of WNBA players compete overseas in the off-season. For most, it's a way to augment their domestic income: WNBA players receive roughly five times more in Russia than they do in the US. \"If she were Steph Curry or LeBron James, she wouldn't be over there at all because she'd be making enough money,\" Ms Spruill said. Ms Griner's counterparts in the men's league make more than 200 times the maximum WNBA salary. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the EuroLeague suspended all Russian teams and US and WNBA officials began calling players out of the country. But it was too late for Brittney Griner, who is believed to have entered Russia one week earlier, on 17 February, though the timing remains unclear. The Russian Federal Customs Service said in a press release that a sniffer dog had led authorities to search the carry-on luggage of an American basketball player and that it had found vape cartridges containing hashish oil. A state-owned Russian news agency, Tass, identified the player as Ms Griner. Russian authorities only confirmed her detention the third week of March, though they disclosed she was stopped at the airport in February. Initially, US authorities and representatives for Brittney Griner were largely silent, other than to say they were working to bring her home. In early May, however, the State Department said it considers Ms Griner to be \"wrongfully\" detained. The case is now reportedly being handled by a special departmental section that specialises in helping release Americans held hostage or wrongfully imprisoned overseas. On 13 May, the US State Department said a consular official the court hearing in which her hearing was extended, and spoke to Griner briefly. A spokesman said Griner was doing \"as well as can be expected during exceedingly difficult circumstances\". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April that American officials are \"doing everything we can\" to help her. \"There's only so much I can say given the privacy considerations at this point,\" Mr Blinken said. Ms Griner's agent, Lindsay Colas, has said she was in \"close contact\" with the player and her lawyer in Russia, but could not comment further. While there is no indication that Ms Griner's arrest was connected to the invasion of Ukraine, some US officials have indicated strained US-Russian relations may jeopardise her safe return. \"We don't want Ms Griner to become a pawn in the political battle that's being waged throughout the world right now,\" said US congressman John Garamendi, a member of the House of Representatives' armed services committee. \"The war in Ukraine has essentially severed diplomatic ties between the US and Russia,\" Mr Garamendi said. \"That is going to exacerbate this issue.\" She could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted on drug charges. The US embassy in Russia did not respond to a request for comment. As Ms Griner's detention grinds on, some fans have been left incredulous by an apparent lack of attention for a world-class athlete in prison among sports media. Some have speculated that the silence was intentional - an effort to avoid inflaming an already precarious situation amid negotiations with Russia. But others, like Ms Spruill, say the somewhat muffled initial coverage on Ms Griner lays bare the clear inequities faced by female athletes. Much more ink has been devoted to male players - whether it is American football player's Tom Brady's on-again, off-again retirement, Novak Djokovic's Covid saga in Australia, or Aaron Rodger's vaccination status - than to Brittney Griner, Ms Spruill points out. More than 260,000 fans have signed an online petition, organised by Ms Spruill, demanding the US government prioritise her safe return and treat her like \"any other sports icon\". \"There has absolutely not been enough coverage,\" Ms Spruill said. \"It's hard for me to read that other than a choice by the broader media.\" Ms Griner's wife, Cherelle, posted on Instagram in April about the painful wait. \"People say 'stay busy.' Yet, there's not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you. My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by,\" she wrote. \"There are no words to express this pain. I'm hurting, we're hurting\".\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

The organizer of a Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT) meeting at the University of North Texas (UNT) says campus police escorted her into a janitor's closet for her own safety after activists disrupted the event featuring Texas House of Representatives candidate Jeff Younger. Younger is the father of a 7-year-old child, who was born James but now goes by Luna, at the center of a 2019 custody battle that attracted national attention\u00a0after his mother encouraged the boy to medically transition into a girl. A Texas judge granted Younger's ex-wife full custody of the child and a sibling in 2019. \"We actually had invited guests for all of our general biweekly meetings. We looked at local political candidates, we looked at local, conservative YouTubers. \u2026 We were just looking at anyone who'd be interesting and who was nearby,\" Kelly Neidert, a 22-year-old senior at UNT and founder of the school's registered YCT chapter, told Fox News Digital. University of North Texas (Google Maps) \"We had heard of Jeff [Younger] before and found out he was actually running for a House district, so we just thought: he has this backstory. He's also running for an election. So he seemed like a good fit, and he was willing to come in,\" she continued. ANTIFA PROTESTERS DISRUPT TEXAS COLLEGE CAMPUS PRO-LIFE PRAYER VIGIL: \u2018F--- YOUR GOD!\u2019 But the March 2 event featuring the conservative congressional candidate and critic of transgender ideology turned into chaos when dozens of activists showed up to the event and scared away other non-disruptive students, Neidert said, adding that about 70% of the 80 attendees \u2014 the maximum capacity \u2014 in the classroom were protesters. Videos posted to Neidert's Twitter and TikTok accounts show protesters screaming, talking over speakers, drawing on a whiteboard in the classroom and taking other disruptive actions. In one video, Younger laughs as one protester screams while he is speaking. About 40 minutes into the meeting, Neidert said things got so chaotic that campus police had to help her and a fellow YCT member exit the room. Once they left the building, they were met with more protesters waiting outside who attempted to follow Neidert and the other YCT member, the 22-year-old said. Officers escorted Neidert\u00a0to a janitor's closet inside another building until eventually leading her back outside and into a police vehicle. TEXAS PROFESSOR SUES UNIVERSITY AFTER BEING PUNISHED FOR SAYING MUSIC THEORY ISN'T RACIST Neidert\u00a0said she had already coordinated with police prior to the event because she had been receiving \"death threats and threats of violence\" at school prior to the event. In a March 3 statement, UNT President Neal Smatresk said campus police bolstered security for the event ahead of time \"[b]ecause conversations surrounding the student organization\u2019s event, which focused on criminalizing healthcare for transgender children, have been contentious,\" adding that \"a few hundred protesters\" had gathered outside the building where the meeting was held since the event was limited to 80 attendees. He added that police \"believe a small group of protestors not affiliated with the university contributed to escalating the overall protest from peaceful to an aggressive encounter.\" \"A group of protestors surrounded the police vehicles containing both the student organizers and their guest and attempted to block their exit from the scene by banging on the vehicles and impeding their movement,\" Smatresk\u00a0said. \"The officers engaged emergency lights and sounded warning sirens repeatedly while inching forward as other officers assisted in clearing a path for the vehicles to exit safely.\" He continued: \"We have always touted the importance of freedom of expression and been proud of our students\u2019 ability to speak up for themselves and participate in nonviolent protest. UNT Police have continuously worked to create and maintain an environment safe for all students to express themselves, regardless of topic.\" The incident did not result in any injuries, according to the school president. It's not the first time activists have come to YCT events on campus and tried to \"down out\" speakers by making noise, Neidert\u00a0explained, but it is the first time she was ever escorted into a janitor's closet for her own safety. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Something always goes wrong with protesters or people vandalizing our stuff,\" she explained. Neidert has received some harassment since the event, \"but nothing too serious.\" \"People have been flipping me off and yelling rude things more than usual, but I haven't felt unsafe,\" she said. \"I do have a group of friends from my Young Conservatives of Texas chapter who are helping me deal with this, and they have also been walking around campus with me so I'm not alone. I've also had a lot of YCT students from other chapters around Texas reach out to me, and that has been very uplifting.\" Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

It is often tempting to look upon Vladimir Putin as the millennium bug in a human and deadly form. The Russian president rose to power on 31 December 1999, as the world held its breath that computers would go into meltdown when the clock struck midnight, unable to process the change from 1999 to 2000. In the 20 years since, Putin has been trying to engineer a different kind of global system malfunction, the destruction of the liberal international order. The former KGB spymaster wanted to turn back the clock: to revive Russia's tsarist greatness and to restore the might and menace of the Soviet Union prior to its break-up in 1991. This Russian revanchist has become the most disruptive international leader of the 21st Century, the mastermind behind so much misery from Chechnya to Crimea, from Syria to the cathedral city of Salisbury. He has sought - successfully at times - to redraw the map of Europe. He has tried - successfully at times - to immobilise the United Nations. He has been determined - successfully at times - to weaken America, and hasten its division and decline. Putin came to power at a moment of western hubris. The United States was the sole superpower in a unipolar world. Francis Fukuyama's End of History thesis, proclaiming the triumph of liberal democracy, was widely accepted. Some economists even peddled the theory that recessions would be no more, partly because of the productivity gains of the new digital economy. It was also thought that globalisation, and the interdependence it wrought, would stop major economic powers fighting wars. The same utopianism attached itself to the internet, which was seen overwhelmingly as a force for global good. In the early days especially, the same misplaced optimism and wishful thinking coloured the west's approach to Putin - a figure, it is now obvious, who was trying to buck history and thwart democratisation, however many lives were lost in the process. Successive US presidents have played into his hands. Bill Clinton, the occupant of the White House when Putin came to power, handed this ultra-nationalist a popular grievance by pushing for the expansion of Nato right up to Russia's borders. As George F Kennan, the famed architect of America's Cold War strategy of containment, warned at the time: \"Expanding Nato would be the most fateful error of America policy in the entire post-Cold War era.\" George W Bush completely misjudged his Russian counterpart. \"I looked the man in the eye,\" Bush famously said after their first meeting in Slovenia in 2001. \"I found him very straightforward and trustworthy\u2026 I was able to get a sense of his soul.\" Bush mistakenly thought he could mount a charm offensive with Putin, and gently cajole him further down the democratic path. But even though Bush visited Russia more than any other country - including, as a personal favour, two trips in 2002 to Putin's home city, St Petersburg - the Russian leader was already displaying dangerously despotic tendencies. In 2008, Bush's final year as president, Putin invaded Georgia - what he called a \"peace enforcement operation\". The Kremlin argued then - and has continued to argue ever since - that it was hypocritical for Washington to complain about this violation of international law after Bush had invaded Iraq. Barack Obama sought to reframe US-Russian relations. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, even handed her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov a mock reset button (which was mistakenly labelled with the Russian word for \"overloaded\"). But Putin knew that America, after its long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, no longer wanted to police the world. When Obama refused in 2013 to enforce his red-line warning against Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator used chemical weapons against his own people, Putin saw a green light. By helping Assad carry out his murderous war, he extended Moscow's sphere of influence in the Middle East when the United States wanted to extract itself from the region. The following year, he annexed Crimea, and established a foothold in eastern Ukraine. Despite being told by Obama to \"cut it out,\" Putin even sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the hope that Hillary Clinton, a long-time nemesis, would be defeated and that Donald Trump, a long-time fan boy, would win. The New York property tycoon made no secret of his admiration for Putin, a sycophantic approach that seems to have further emboldened the Russian president. Much to Moscow's delight, Trump publicly criticised Nato, weakened the US post-war alliance system and became such a polarising figure that he left America more politically divided than at any time since the Civil War. Arguably, then, you have to reach back 30 years to find a US leader whose approach to the Kremlin has stood the test of time. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, George Herbert Walker Bush resisted the temptation to rejoice in America's Cold War victory - much to the astonishment of the White House press pack, he refused to travel to Berlin for a victory lap - knowing that it would bolster hardliners in the Politburo and military seeking to oust Mikhail Gorbachev. That magnanimity in victory helped when it came to bringing about the reunification of Germany, which was arguably Bush's greatest foreign policy success. Putin is obviously a more formidable adversary, harder to deal with than even Leonid Brezhnev or Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet premier during the Cuban Missile Crisis. But since the turn of the century no US president has truly had his measure. Joe Biden, like George Herbert Walker Bush, is a Cold War warrior, who has dedicated his presidency to defending democracy at home and abroad. Seeking to re-establish America's traditional post-war role as the leader of the free world, he has sought to mobilise the international community, offered military aid to Ukraine and adopted the toughest sanction regime ever targeted against Putin. As Russian forces amassed at the border, he also shared US intelligence showing that Putin had decided to invade, in ways that sought to disrupt the Kremlin's usual misinformation campaigns and false flag operations. His State of the Union address became a rallying cry. \"Freedom will always triumph over tyranny,\" he said. And while Biden does not speak with the clarity or force of a Kennedy or a Reagan, it was nonetheless a significant speech. What's been striking since the Russian invasion started, however, has been the assertion of forceful presidential leadership from elsewhere. Volodymyr Zelensky has been lauded and lionised, as he has continued this extraordinary personal journey from comedian to Churchillian colossus. In Brussels, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has been another commanding presence. This former German politician has been a driving force behind the decision, for the first time in EU history, to finance and purchase weapons for a nation under attack, a commitment that includes not just ammunition but fighter jets as well. Her compatriot, the new Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, has also shown more resolve in dealing with Putin than his predecessor Angela Merkel. At warp speed, he has overturned decades of post-Cold War German foreign policy, an approach so often predicated on caution and timidity towards the Russian leader. Berlin has sent anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine (ending the policy of not sending weapons to active war zones), halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, withdrawn its opposition to blocking Russia from the SWIFT international payments system, and even committed to spending 2% of its GDP on defence spending. The biggest assault on a European state since World War Two has stiffened European resolve. But so, too, it seems has the relative weakness of America. Mindful of the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan and possibility of a Trump 2.0 presidency, European leaders seem to have realised that they can no longer lean so heavily on Washington to defend democracy in this hour of maximum peril. Leadership of the free world has, in this crisis, become a common endeavour. Even since the end of the Cold War, Washington has been calling upon European nations to do more to police its own neighbourhood, something they failed to do when the break-up of the former Yugoslavia sparked the Bosnian war. Historians may well conclude that it took a combination of Putin's aggressiveness, America's fragility, Ukraine's heroic resolve and the fear that Europe's post-war stability is truly on the line to finally make that happen. This video can not be played Watch: What Americans think of Biden's Ukraine response It would be naive to be swept away by the romanticism of Zelensky's speeches or to succumb to the dopamine high of watching the seizure of Russian-owned super-yachts unfold on social media. Putin is intensifying the war. But the last week has sent a message to Moscow - and to Beijing as well - that the post-war international order still continues to function, despite the deployment of the Russian war machine to bring about its collapse. Just as history never ended, nor has liberal democracy. As Joe Biden put it in his State of the Union, during a passage in which rhetoric served also as sober analysis: Putin \"thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met a wall of resistance he never imagined\". Nick Bryant is the author of When America Stopped Being Great: a history of the present.

The group hope to be the first all-black team to climb Mount Everest. The other nine members of the team are Americans. About 6,000 climbers are known to have conquered Everest to date, but fewer than 10 people of African origin are in this exclusive group. The Full Circle Everest team hopes to more than double that number. They have just left base camp and hope to reach the summit in about two months. At 62, Mr Kagambi is the oldest in the team of experienced mountaineers. He has summitted all the highest peaks in Africa, as well as the highest point in four continents, and hopes to become the first African to achieve all seven. He was the first black African to conquer Denali -  the highest peak in North America. \"The main goal of our expedition is to encourage people of colour to go out, to venture into the mountains, so that it's not just white people out there. It is also to show people that they can do it, because there are people who they feel like this is not for us [black people], it is for them,\" he told the BBC before leaving for Nepal. Although many Nepalese and Indians have climbed Everest - often as guides, mountaineering is often seen as a white person's sport, especially in the West - something that Mr Kagambi grapples with in the US as a mountaineering instructor and guide. It comes in the form of clients who don't trust in his skill because of his ethnicity. \"Before people realise what I have done, especially when I meet white people in the US, you see some people hesitating. Until you prove to them that you know what you are doing - that's when they open up. I see that quite a bit,\" he said. The former primary school teacher fell in love with mountains in 1973 when as a teenager he watched in awe from his village at the midnight fireworks on the peak of Mount Kenya as the country celebrated its first decade of independence from British colonial rule. \"That was really unique and I remember saying: 'I wish I can do that.' But I never thought I would.\" Years later, after graduating from a teachers' training college, he made an attempt on Mount Kenya and reached the summit. \"The first time I stepped on the snow, I knew that it's something I really loved doing. And I kept going back and liking it more,\" he said. But his path to scaling Everest has been the steepest. On two previous attempts, being Kenyan was his undoing after American sponsors insisted that beneficiaries must be US residents. \"The last one was very close - like four months before the expedition - that's when I was struck off. That was frustrating but rules have to be followed,\" he said - a glimpse of the stoicism learnt from the mountains and which pervades his speech. Climbing Everest isn't cheap - up to $85,000 (\u00a365,000) - and he had given up trying because age was catching up with him. Then an email in January 2021 from his American friend and fellow mountaineer Philip Henderson changed everything. \"My immediate reaction was that I wouldn't do it. I told him that I'm too old and my knees are already not good on the mountains.\" But Mr Henderson insisted, pointing to reviews from other mountaineers who hailed Mr Kagambi as a guide who was \"encouraging and supportive, especially to women\". Getting admission into the team was the easiest hurdle. Finding sponsors proved the most difficult obstacle, as the traditional way of knocking on corporate doors proved futile. \"The hardest part for me was that I expected to work towards going to Everest in terms of training but I didn't have the facilities and the finance to do that.\" Frustrated, out of funds and with no sponsorship, a breakthrough came through a WhatsApp group of his friends who were raising funds for the expedition. Contributions were trickling in slowly and there was little hope in sight. Then word reached a Kenyan betting firm, which immediately offered a sponsorship deal, which covers Mr Kagambi's training, travel allowance, insurance and operational logistics. Part of his rigorous training regime has included scaling Mount Kenya six times from January to April. That was followed by a two-week expedition on the Rwenzori mountains in neighbouring Uganda. The Full Circle Everest team also met in January for a reconnaissance and team-building session in Nepal. Earlier, from July to December last year he was in the US and carrying 50kg bags while hiking for months and training students. \"I've been on the mountain all the time. Because of my knees, the best thing for me is to be out there hiking as high as I can for training,\" he said. His family is worried about his wellbeing, especially because climbing Mount Everest is such a dangerous undertaking. \"I really hope it goes well because at this point we know there are only two outcomes - it's either he goes and comes back, or he goes and doesn't come back. There's that anxiety, there's that fear, but we don't want to show him,\" his daughter Cynthia said. But Mr Kagambi seems unfazed and defiantly declared that he had done riskier things in his life. He also pointed to his long experience of navigating through snow, glaciers, ice and rocks. \"I'm confident of summitting Mount Everest, but the other thing I say is - I will not put my life at risk to do it. I have done enough mountaineering to know my body. I can assess and tell myself it's time to go back,\" he said.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-biased"}]}

It sounds ripped from the script of an action movie, but the job advert is real - taken from an employment website, Silent Professionals, for those working in the private military and security industry. And, insiders say, demand is growing. Amid a gut-wrenching war in Ukraine, US and European private contractors say they are increasingly eying opportunities, ranging from 'extraction' missions to helping with logistics. There is \"a frenzy in the market\" for private contractors in Ukraine today, said Robert Young Pelton, a Canadian American author and expert on private military companies (PMCs). But the demand for paid security workers - many of them former soldiers with ability to fight and kill - in the midst of a war leaves plenty of room for mistakes, and the potential for bedlam. Even as Westerns volunteers are joining the fight in Ukraine, for which they can expect to be paid the same as their Ukrainian counterparts, money is being offered by private interests for security services like the one advertised on Silent Professionals. The recruitment platform would not say who it was advertising for, but according to Mr Pelton, contractors are being hired for between $30,000 and $6m to help remove people from Ukraine. The higher-end figure is for whole groups of families wanting to leave with their assets, he said. The price of evacuations depends on the complexity of the work, said Tony Schiena, CEO of Mosaic, a US-headquartered intelligence and security advisory firm already operating in Ukraine. \"When there's a larger amount of people, the risk goes up. Children and families are more difficult. It all depends on the methods we get them across\". Mosaic's missions are largely intelligence-driven, rather than armed, said Mr Schiena, a former South African intelligence operative whose firm includes several former high-ranking US intelligence officials on its board. They are working with private clients, corporations and PIPs - politically exposed people - to help evacuate them from Ukraine, Mr Schiena told the BBC. He claimed an \"intelligence agency of a pretty large country\" that wanted to get its citizens out was among his clients. \"Depending on how the conflict plays out, I think there will be a constant demand for [PMCs],\" Mr Schiena said. \"There's a constant need, and as [the war] escalates or de-escalates, there's always going to be something that we're approached to do\". Private military and security firms have existed for decades, but were thrust into the public eye during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11, working on behalf of Western governments and commercial interests. At the height of the Iraq war, tens of thousands of private contractors, such as Blackwater, were operating there. Tasks ranged from armed missions such as convoy protection to feeding and housing troops at military bases. Blackwater became notorious after a number of high-profile incidents, including the death of 14 Iraqi civilians shot dead by its contractors in Baghdad in 2007. In Eastern Europe, private firms have long been used to protect wealthy people and corporations. During the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, a number of firms were also hired to help equip, train and organise Bosnian and Croatian forces - all with the blessing of the US government. The nature of the industry means that tracking the number of contractors and money is difficult, but it is by all accounts a growing industry. A report from Aerospace & Defense News found that the global private military and security industry will be worth over $457bn (\u00a3348bn) in 2030, up from about $224bn in 2020. Foreign military contractors say they are not fighting in Ukraine. Some say they are being approached to help NGOs and humanitarian organisations in Ukraine or neighbouring countries in need of people with specialised skills and experience working in austere conditions in conflict zones. \"Most of the guys I personally know going over are doctors, physician assistants, paramedics, nurses and former special ops guys - or non-special ops guys - who are combat vets and understand,\" said Mykel Hawke, a former US special forces officer who has worked as a war zone contractor. Western contractors are governed by the laws and regulations of their own countries, said Christopher Mayer, a former US Army Colonel who worked with PMCs in Iraq. They are supposed to protect people, places or assets, rather than engage in direct combat. Many in the industry bristle at the suggestion that they are 'mercenaries' or soldiers of fortune. \"It's the same kind of work that you see in the United States and elsewhere,\" Mr Mayer said. \"The difference is that in areas of conflict, the likelihood of having to use lethal force is much, much higher\". In practice, though, the line is blurry. \"If you have the skillset to be a private contractor, you have the skillset to be a mercenary. There's no bright line between the two,\" said Sean McFate, an-ex US paratrooper who later served as a contractor in Africa and elsewhere. \"It comes down to market circumstances and the decision of the individual person.\" \"People talk about legitimacy and who the client is. None of that matters,\" he added. \"If you can do one, you can do the other\". The proliferation of PMCs may lead to as much \"chaos and mayhem\" as good, he warned. \"Mercenaries historically elongate conflict for profit,\" he added. \"It could get to a point in the mid-century where super-rich people have private armies, and I don't know how that looks.\" Examples of such companies taking an offensive approach to conflict include the South Africa-based Executive Outcomes, which fought on behalf of the government of Angola and Sierra Leone in the 1990s. Sandline International, headquartered in London, was involved in conflicts in Papua New Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. And members of Russian mercenary groups are said to be on the ground in Ukraine. But Simon Mann, the former British special forces officer founder for Executive Outcomes and Sandline, told the BBC that the prospect of using Western contractors for offensive missions in Ukraine is \"highly unlikely\" and would pose complicated legal and organisational questions. \"How [would they be] funded? How [would they be] commanded? Where would they fit in the Ukraine order of battle?\" he asked. \"Would they be duly enrolled in the national armed forces before any operations? If not, then what would be their legal position? Casualties? Medical cover? Death and disability insurance?\" Mr Mann - who spent several years in prison after being accused of leading an aborted coup d'\u00e9tat in Equatorial Guinea in 2004 - said that he is aware, however, of evacuation missions charging \u00a310,000 per person, \"mostly organised by PMC-type people who happen to have contacts on the ground\". Some have warned that even paid-for rescue missions into Ukraine could be fraught with danger for contractors and clients alike, and that the industry is awash with people misrepresenting their ability or experience. Orlando Wilson, a former British soldier and long-time security contractor, said that he believes that most of the talk surrounding private contractors in Ukraine is \"rubbish\". \"I don't see how people can operate in Ukraine at the moment, at least not privately,\" he said. \"If you're caught by either side or one of the militias, they'll just take you as a spy and that's it,\" Mr Wilson added. \"It wouldn't be safe for people doing it and it wouldn't be safe for the clients\".

One, from last week, shows a Russian helicopter flying low, just above the tree line - in the hope of avoiding what's about to happen next. Tracking its path is the smoking trail of a surface-to-air missile. In a matter of seconds the missile has found its target. On impact the Russian helicopter crashes to the ground, before bursting into a fireball Russian aircraft are being shot down by Ukrainian forces - as well as the video above, this video shows a jet hit near Kharkiv - and military analysts believe there's evidence that recently supplied weapons by the West are already being used. Justin Bronk, a research fellow on airpower at the Royal United Services Institute, says there's been visual confirmation of at least 20 Russian aircraft shot down in Ukraine so far - both helicopters and jets. That's significantly fewer than claimed by Ukraine's ministry of defence, which says it has downed 48 Russian planes and 80 helicopters. Yet even the lower number shows Russia's struggled to gain supremacy in the skies. Ukraine has suffered losses too. But UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that Russia had so far not been successful in destroying the country's air defences and air force. Before the war began, Ukraine's military aircraft were outnumbered at least three-to-one by those that had been amassed on the border by Russia. Mr Wallace said Ukraine's ability to keep some of its air defences intact was already forcing Russian aircraft to fly at night to avoid detection. Shoulder-launched air defence missiles, also known as Manpads (man-portable air defence systems) are just one of the weapons that Western nations have been supplying to Ukraine. They include the infamous US-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles - scourge of Soviet aircraft during its occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Exact numbers are hard to come by. Last week Mr Wallace told the BBC the West had now delivered \"thousands\" of anti-tank weapons and \"over a thousand\" Stingers. CNN, quoting a US defence official, put the total at 17,000 anti-tank weapons and 2,000 Stingers, sent by the US and Nato allies. Britain and America had provided weapons to Ukraine before the invasion began on 24 February, with the UK delivering 2,000 light anti-tank missiles (Nlaws). Commenting on reports that they were already being used to destroy Russian armoured columns, Mr Wallace said \"we've got anecdotal evidence to verify that\". Most countries, though, only started to send weapons in response to the Russian invasion. In all, 14 nations have supplied arms. They include Sweden and Finland, both of which have a long history of neutrality and are not members of Nato. But both have sent thousands of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Germany has supplied 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles. The Baltic states have also delivered thousands of weapons including Stingers and Javelin missiles, one of the world's most effective anti-tank weapons with a range of 2.5km (1.5 miles). Ukraine says it has already successfully destroyed several Russian T-72 tanks. Recent weapons deliveries also include tens of thousands of assault rifles and machine guns, anti-tank mines and hundreds of tonnes of ammunition, as well as body armour and helmets, and medical supplies. How are the weapons getting through? The UK says it is helping \"facilitate\" the deliveries of these weapons. Western officials, though, are not giving details of how the supplies are getting through. But it's no secret that while Russia's military operations have been focused in eastern Ukraine, the flow of people and supplies from the west of the country has continued via neighbouring European states. The BBC has spoken to the defence ministries of Estonia, Sweden and Denmark, all of whom confirmed their weapons supplies had been tracked and successfully reached Ukraine in recent weeks. So, how much difference are these weapons consignments making? Weapons supplied by the West can make a difference, but only if Ukraine continues to have armed forces capable of using them. Mr Bronk says Ukraine's ability to retain some of its older, Soviet-era, air defence systems - which have a longer range - has forced Russian aircraft to fly lower. But that makes them more vulnerable to the shorter-range surface-to-air missiles being supplied by the West. Without those longer-range air defence systems, Russian aircraft could fly higher to avoid the dangers of shorter-range air defences. Meanwhile, America and European allies are looking to increase their arms supplies to Ukraine. There may be a limited opportunity before Russia tries to target any supply lines of weapons. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said he's had talks with Poland about it supplying Russian-made Mig fighter jets to the Ukrainian Air Force. But even if that happened, Ukraine would still need trained pilots to fly them. The supply of Western weapons helps, but you still need an army that knows how to use them.\n    \nDetermine if this article biased based on the user point of view?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is-not-biased"}]}

The individual was arrested as he was being released from a Dumas hospital Wednesday morning on charges of first-degree battery and aggravated assault, Arkansas State Police said in a statement. It was unclear why the individual was hospitalized and whether he had an attorney who would comment. Authorities previously indicated they were searching for two suspects in addition to one person who officials said Sunday had been taken into custody by the Dumas Police Department on unrelated charges. That person has since been released on bond, Arkansas State Police told CNN on Wednesday, emphasizing the charges are not connected to the shooting. Arkansas State Police initially said 28 people had been wounded, but adjusted the figure in a Facebook post on Monday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe discrepancy appears to be attributed to one patient admitted locally and later transferred to another hospital.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Five children between the ages of 19 months and 11 years old were among the wounded, the agency said Monday. At a news conference Sunday afternoon, police identified the person killed as 23-year-old Cameron Shaffer of Jacksonville, Arkansas. There was no indication Shaffer was involved in the act of shooting itself, they said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur thoughts and prayers are with his family and also with all the families and our shooting victims as a result of this incident,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Col. Bill Bryant of Arkansas State Police told reporters. Police believe there was \u201a\u00c4\u00fano mass shooting intended,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with the incident triggered by two individuals who exchanged fire around 7 p.m. CT (8 p.m. ET) Saturday at the community car show. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shocking,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have a small community, a farming community in Dumas of 5,000 people and then we have an incident of multi-victims \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 You don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t expect that from small-town Arkansas.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Gov.

Earlier Sunday, state police said 24 people had been wounded in the incident, while Arkansas Children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Hospital said it had treated six victims aged under 18. The hospital said the children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wounds were non-life-threatening and most of them had been released from the hospital following treatment. \u201a\u00c4\u00faArkansas Children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Hospital in Little Rock received six patients under 18 with gun shot wounds from the incident, none fatal. Most of the patients have been treated and released,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hilary DeMillo, media relations manager for the hospital, told CNN in an email. Bryant told the news conference five children \u201a\u00c4\u00ec aged 11, 9, 8, 23 months and 19 months \u201a\u00c4\u00ec were transported to Arkansas Children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Hospital after the incident and that police were working to verify whether a sixth child was involved. Five victims had since been released from the hospital, he said. At least 8 people were killed and more than 60 hurt in mass shootings across the US this weekend Family members identified three of the five children Monday. Angelo Ussery Sr. told CNN his 1-year-old son, Angelo Ussery Jr., was shot in the leg while at the show with his mother. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen she called me she was in an uproar and I just broke down,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ussery said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just had to find a way to get to this hospital I never been to before. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen I saw the wound, I couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t believe. He had a hole in his leg and they had to fly him to the children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hospital.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The child is expected to make a full recovery, his father said. Frankie Spicer Sr. had a similar scare when friends began reaching out to him to let him know there was a shooting at the car show where his mother and two children were. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI kept calling my mother but a stranger picked up and told me he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know who the phone belonged to but there was a woman and a child laid out on the floor,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Spicer said. Spicer told CNN his 11-year-old son, Frankie Spicer Jr., was shot in the hand and his 8-year-old daughter, Aaliyah Spicer, was shot in the leg while waiting in line for funnel cake. His mother, Felecia Kimble, was shot in the stomach. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMy daughter told me there were people stepping over them and my son told me he got up and ran to get help,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe ran to police and told them my mom and his little sister were shot.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Spicer said police transported them to a local hospital. His family is expected to make a full recovery, he said. Arkansas State Police said in an earlier news release Sunday that special agents from its Criminal Investigation Division had interviewed victims and witnesses overnight. Investigators secured the scene, which sits along US Highway 65 as it goes through the center of Dumas, it said. The car show was hosted by the Hood-Nic Foundation and Delta Neighborhood Empowerment Organization, a group providing educational programs and support for Dumas-area youth, according to their website. Dumas is about 80 miles southeast of Little Rock. According to Delta N.E.Y.O website, the annual Hood-Nic, (Neighborhood Picnic) of which the car show has been a part for 16 years, takes place annually over spring break weekend to raise funds for \u201a\u00c4\u00fascholarships, school supplies, and more to deserving individuals.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are heartbroken and in shock at what took place during tonight\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s car show,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Hood-Nic Foundation said in a Facebook post Saturday night. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe purpose of Hood-Nic has always been to bring the community together,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the post said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis senseless violence needs to end.
